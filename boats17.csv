On July 1, 2017, at approximately 2:26 P.M., vessel 1, bearing TX 8493 BK, was navigating north on Meadow Lake in Guadalupe County. Operator1 was operating vessel 1 and was wearing a US Coast guard approved life jacket with a safety lanyard. Operator1 was in full care, custody, and control of the vessel.  Operator1 was the only person on board vessel 1. Operator1 did not have any prior experience operating vessel 1 nor had she completed a boater safety education course. 

Operator1 began her course of travel. Operator1 stated she was not advised of the boater safety education course requirement prior to operating the vessel. Operator1 was not aware of the required safety equipment for PWCs nor the prohibition of operating a PWC within 50 feet in excess of headway speed. 


Impact with dock of vessel 1

As vessel 1 was navigating north, the boat accident witnesses, stated vessel 1 was navigating at a high rate of speed. The witnesses heard the crash when Vessel 1 collided with the dock. While navigating vessel 1, Operator1 attempted to turn the vessel port side but was unable to control the vessel's speed. The vessel turned 90 degrees and collided with the dock. When the vessel collided with the dock Operator1 was thrown into the water and the vessel went underneath the dock. The collision caused parts of the vessel to be broken off. 

Subject1 inside her house when she heard vessel 1 crash into her dock. They arrived at the vessel accident at the same time and saw Operator1 still inside the water. They stated the vessel had impacted the dock with such force that the vessel was lodged under the dock. Subject2 stated he had to step on the vessel's stern in order to recover it from underneath the dock. The dock sustained damage to the wooden boards that support the dock. Vessel 1 sustained significant damage to the bow, hull, starboard side, handlebars, and throttle. Operator1 sustained significant lacerations to her leg and hand, as well as bruising to her rib cage and visceral area.  The vessel was recovered by the guests and residents. They took the vessel out of the water and put it on a trailer. 

First responders arrive at the scene
4Operator1 declined an ambulance transport to the hospital but later she checked herself into the hospital. Operator1 received stitches for the lacerations to her hand and leg. The Seguin Police Department case number is 34667. Upon examining the vessel, it was impossible to determine whether mechanical failure was a factor, due to the damage sustained to the steering handle bars and throttle lever.

The next day, Operator1 was interviewed by Warden. While being interviewed by Warden, Operator1 stated she was navigating only at approximately 5 miles per hour. In her statement, Operator1 stated that when she attempted to turn the steering handlebars locked and she was unable to operate the vessel. Operator1 was issued citations for violating the boater safety requirements and a PWC operated within 50 feet in excess of headway speed. 


The contributing factors to the boat accident include:  
1.	Operator inexperience 
2.	Excessive speed 
3.	Fail to control speed 
4.	No boater education
5.	Operating a PWC within 50 feet in excess of headway speed.

We were informed that a subject had fell off of a pontoon boat and had received lacerations to their foot and needed medical attention.  The beige Sweetwater pontoon boat was to meet Ocean City EMS at 49th street, just south of Seacrets.
      
      On arrival, we saw the beige Sweetwater pontoon boat tied up to the dock just south of 49th street with Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) on scene.  OFC. from OCPD informed us that Ocean City EMS had transported the subject to Peninsula Regional Medical Center Located in Salisbury,MD.   Victim had received deep lacerations across her lower back, buttocks, legs and right foot.  After receiving information I took statements.  I spoke with the operator of the vessel later and CPL spoke with the other passengers on the vessel.

      While speaking with Operator I smelled an odor of alcohol emanating from her person.  She advised she had only had one Bloody Mary around 1100hrs but she was holding clothes that had alcohol spilled on them.  At this point, I asked Operator to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST's) to which she said she would not mind.  While talking to Operator, she stated that she was allergic to the sun and that her hands and feet were swelling up and that the dock was too hot for her to stay on.  I advised here we could go in the shade of the carport underneath the condominium that was nearby to which she seemed content with.  I also allowed her to put her sandals on due to the temperature of the pavement.  After she was situated, I ran her through SFST's which showed negative results. 

      At this point I received all of Operator' information, the rental vessel information and any additional information I needed for an accident report.  I also asked Operator what happened that would make Victim fall off of the vessel.  She advised me that Victim was highly intoxicated and was dancing on the front part of the vessel with another occupant of the vessel, but not outside of the front gate.  

She said Victim fell into the front gate and rolled over it head first, falling into the water and between the front two pontoons.  She then told me they didn't see Victim surface for some time and then when she finally came up she was screaming something. She said that Occupant1 had jumped in and grabbed Victim and eventually Operator grabbed a life jacket and jumped in to help her.  The two girls swam Victim back to the vessel and helped her get back up the ladder.  Operator said they laid her down on the seat and occupant1, who has training in the medical field, wrapped her foot and elevated it.  Another occupant of the vessel called 911 to advise them that Victim needed medical attention.

      From this point on, Operator headed to the nearest open dock she could see.  They arrived at the dock just south of Seacrets and Ocean City Police and Fire/EMS were on scene.  Victim was transported to Peninsula Regional Medical Center and eventually flown to University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center located in Baltimore,MD to see a specialist.  

      I spoke with Operator on July, 17th 2017 and she advised that Victim was still being held at Shock Trauma in Baltimore but has regained slight feeling in her toes after the surgery.

In the emails, Operator stated he had an accident of $9800 on Labor Day and was concerned about the safety of the lake due to the lack of bouys marking all the submerged trees.  I made contact with Operator by phone in early November and asked if we could meet to discuss the boating accident as a report needed to be made.  Operator advised he would be out of state for most of the month and would contact me when he returned.  Operator contacted me at the end of November and I advised I would contact him when I had time due to the deer season.  

On 12/16/17 I made contact with Operator by phone and set up a meeting time for 12/19/17 at 0900 hours.  I asked Operator if he had the boat or if it was in a shop.  Operator advised he had the boat back and repairs had been made through Shady Creek Marina and Midwest Boats.  I contacted Midwest boats and asked about the damage and was advised a 6 inch hole had punctured the bottom of the boat and there was 4 feet worth of damage around the hole which didn''t go through.  I was also told there was damage to the I/O unit and propeller and the total damages was $9800.  

On 12/19/17 at 0900 hours I made contact with Operator at his residence.  I asked Operator to describe the accident and was told the following.  Operator was on the boat with his wife and friends and had been tubing earlier in the day.  Operator decided to show his friends the rock quarry area and traveled to the north part of the lake.  Operator described a well known route to the rock quarry in which you need to drive through a channel of trees to the NE of sail boat cove.  

Operator stated he had watched 2 other boats go through the channel and thought he was following in the same path when he felt the boat strike something under the water.  Operator stated he was going around 20mph when he hit the object which he felt was a submerged tree.  Operator stated he continued to the rock quarry and shut off the engine of the boat and noticed a large amount of water going out the side of the boat through the bilge pump.  Operator then stated he lifted up the compartment for the water skis and saw it was full of water.  Operator then took the boat and returned under power to the boat ramp and took the boat off the water.  I collected the information for the report and talked to Operator about the requirements of a boat owner to report a boat accident when it occurs.  Operator was issued a written warning for failure to report a boat accident.

Victim who was 15 weeks pregnant was transported to the hospital to be treated for a separated shoulder.   Victim stated that the boat bearing registration RI-3201W.  

The following day (10-14-17), EPO made contact with Boat Operator (vessel 1) at his home.  Operator stated that he departed Bristol Marina at approximately 7:30pm headed towards Prudence Is.  He stated that he was not using his radar.  Shortly after obtaining his cruising speed he observed a flicker reflecting from something shinny right before the collision and put his boat in full reverse.  He observed that the other vessel did not have any navigational lights on prior to the crash.  EPO reported that Victim said that Vessel 2 road over Vessel 1's port bow thrusting her diagonally across the boat from where she was sitting.  Operator grabbeD to prevent her from being ejected from the boat.  Operator said both parties checked the status of each other and then departed to Bristol Marina to meet Bristol Fire/Rescue and Police.

On Oct 15, 2017 EPO went to the residence of Boat Operator of Vessel 2.  Each party was interviewed separately and their account of what happened was consistent.  Operator reported that the collision occurred while traveling around Poppasquash Pt.  He stated he did not observed any navigational lights illuminated from the other vessel before the impact.  He was also not using his radar that evening.  Operator2 said his navigational light were on prior to departing the Marina.  Occupant on v2 stated that she observed red and green running lights from the other vessel prior to the impact. 

Based on EPO investigation, both operators violated Rule 5- Improper Lookout and Rule 7, Risk of Collision § 83.07 of the Navigational Rules.  There was no conclusive evidence to show that navigational lights on both vessels were not illuminated and were not a factor in the collision.  Both operators stated that they did not see the other vessel.  Both operators should have been able to determine the position of the other vessel and take appropriate action to avoid a collision.  Neither boat was utilizing their radar.  Their inattentiveness and failure to avoid the collision appears to be a contributing factor in the accident.

V1 came around Unknown vessel and was struck in the bow by V2 who could not see V1 around Unknown vessel.

After interviews and witness statements, it appears that Operator1, who was driving a rented jet ski, was headed north in Little Sarasota Bay near Midnight Pass back to the dock.  V2 under the command of owner/operator Operator2 was headed south through the Intercostal Waterway (ICW). According to statements, Operator2 was maneuvering around another unidentified boat and Operator1 on V1 was not paying attention to the water in front of him and was looking back to his friend who was on another jet ski.  When Operator1 turned back around, he was too close to avoid a collision with V2 and was struck in the rear port-side of V1.  There was considerable damage to V1 but the operator was not thrown from V1 and was uninjured.  

  According to two witness statements, Operator1 and his friends were jumping the wake of another vessel and when he lost control of V1.  According to statements, Operator2, the operator of the V2, saw V1 come from behind the other vessel and quickly attempted to change course and speed by putting his throttle into reverse to try to avoid a collision but there was not enough time to avoid V1.


Upon speaking to the owner of Siesta Key Motorsports, V1 is not salvageable and will have to be replaced. Owners estimates the value of V1 at $8,000.

O1 reached back to adjust his direction of travel on the motor.  When O1 did so, he fell back into the Port side of the stern of the vessel.  When O1 did so, it caused the stern to dip below the level of the water causing the vessel to take on water.  

The vessel rapidly filled with water.  Before the vessel completely submerged O1 exited the vessel.  At this time O1 was not wearing a PFD and stated that he was unable to get it on while in the water.  O1 used the PFD onboard to provide floatation.  O1 stated that he was in the water for approximately 15 minutes before he began to call for help.

Operator was following a commercial barge down the river and attempted to traverse under the 106th street bridge. The bridge tender raised the bridge following a hail from a commercial barge/tug and began lowering the bridge once the barge cleared the bridge. The Bridge tender stated her vision was obstructed by the light of the sun and was unable to see Operator’s vessel transiting the river. The Bridge tender did not recall another vessel requesting bridge operation. 

Operator stated he was following the barge and did not hail the bridge because it was already raised when his vessel neared it. Operator''s vessel was entering the area under the bridge as the bridge was being lowered. Operator''s vessel did not have enough clearance and struck the bridge. The impact caused stress fractures in the fiberglass on the flying bridge as well as breaking the GPS/Radar dome off of the housing on the top of the vessel.

At this time the USCG was made aware of one capsized vessel with two people in the water.  

USCG responding vessel 45696, arrived on scene  around 1216 and recovered  (operator) at 1221.  Upon further investigation, Operator1 advised that the passenger had been with the capsized vessel but because of the waves and current was carried to the shore.   I Officer, of the NC Wildlife Resources Commission Division of Law Enforcement was informed of the incident and began my investigation.  On September 17, 2017, I met with Operator1 and was informed of how the vessel had capsized.  

He explained that he and Occupant had gone out fishing between 0600 and the time of the incident.  Operator1 explained that when they began to come back into shore that he waited for the tide to change.  At this time, Operator1 entered an unmarked Browns Inlet and advised he was surfing the waves with little to no throttle.  The vessel was then on top of what Operator1 described as a rogue wave and crested sooner than he had thought and at the same time felt a thrust of what must have been another wave pushing the vessel over the crest of the wave.  

Operator1 explained that he felt the bow of the boat turn starboard and then the port of the bow went under the water and flipped.  Operator1 and Occupant were under the water and not wearing life jackets. 

 Operator1 then swam under the vessel and grabbed two life jackets and threw one to Occupant.  Operator1 stayed with the vessel holding on to the ladder of the vessel while Occupant was being knocked and swept away from the vessel by the waves and current.  Operator1 advised that Occupant began to float away along with several items of debris coming from the vessel toward the shore of the beach.  At this time, Operator1 began signaling for help.

Warden1 also observed that they didn't have any life jackets, fire extinguisher, a type IV flotation device, nor a horn or whistle.  Warden1 turned the operators of the vessel back to either get off the water or to go buy 2 life jackets.  Warden1 confirmed through receipts and statements made by the owner of the vessel, that there was 1 adult life jacket and 1 type IV purchased at the marina.

Subjects continued their patrol on Lake Stillhouse, and at approximately 1651hrs they were, S.E. of the island, traveling south east.  Warden1 spotted a partially submerged vessel on in the water approximately 80-100yds from the South shore of lake Stillhouse.  As they approached the scene Warden1 recognized the vessel as it being one checked by them approximately 90 minutes earlier, inside the Stillhouse Marina area.

Warden1 observed that there was a debris field that was south of the partially submerged vessel.  Warden1 observed one seat cushion and a plastic tackle box, and other items floating in the debris field.  Warden1 knew that they were looking for, at least, two occupants that were on the vessel and began to search the waters for them. 

 Rider spotted one of the men on a rock along the South shoreline.  Warden1 yelled to him where is the other guy?  Warden1 turned the boat back around and headed back toward the submerged boat and saw the male on shore pointing into the water saying, ""There, There."" 
 
Warden1 rounded the submerged vessel and approximately 20ft from the submerged boat, floating face down, with his arms outstretched, was a white male.  Warden1 pulled up next to the victim who was unresponsive and we rolled him so that he was face up.  The three occupants on the patrol vessel attempted multiple times to get the victim into the vessel, but were unable to do so.  Warden1 made the determination to keep the victims head out of the water, with the assistance of the two occupants, in his vessel, and took the victim to the south shore, where subject began CPR.  

Warden1 summoned the other occupant of the boat to come to them and assist with loading the victim in the patrol vessel and head to the North shore, at Stillhouse Park, were County Sheriffs and other emergency personnel could assist with the victim.

While in transport from the South shore to Stillhouse Park subjects continued with CPR.

Once at Stillhouse Park, Warden1, beached the boat and Deputies assisted with CPR.
There were 5 different first responders, working rotation work, to continually to CPR for approximately 40 minutes until EMT's showed up on scene and began their attempt at reviving the victim.

Victim was transported to Seaton Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Unknown time of death.

Survivor advised that they went back and purchased one adult life jacket and one type four floatation device at the Marina after we stopped them.  He advised that the clerk stated that they didn't have any more adult life jackets so that's why he only purchased one regular life jacket and a type four.  

Survivor stated that they head out and cruised around on the lake and they came to the location where they were found and his brother asked if he wanted to drift fish here for a little while.  Survivor stated that they stopped the boat and both were fishing at the front of the boat facing the South shoreline.  (The wind had picked up with a front that came through and the waves were coming over the back.  This was unknown at the time) While they were fishing his brother observed that their boat was taking on water.  Survivor said he looked back and the cowling on the motor was almost submerged.  He ran back to the motor and it wouldn't start.  Survivor stated that he moved the shifter in panic making sure it was in neutral.  By this time the boat started to sink faster and the compartment the life jacket and type four were in was submerged and they believed the boat was going to completely sink.  Survivor and Victim made the decision to jump off the boat and swim to shore.  

Half way to shore Survivor looked back and could see his brother struggling.  He yelled to calm down and don't panic, just float.  Survivor said he made it to shore and saw no one.  He climbed on top of a rock and observed us coming his way fast.  He said that his brother was still treading water as we were coming toward them and Victim yelled something, inaudible, to his brother.  Survivor yelled back to swim to the boat because we were coming and would be there soon, just hang on.  

Survivor stated then we showed up and his brother was just floating there.

Survivor stated he had only been under water for less than 2 minutes.

Upon arriving at the River's End boat ramp I interviewed the witnesses to the accident. The witnesses stated that they initially observed Vessel 1 operating in a circular manner at the intersection of the San Bernard River and the Intra-Coastal Canal. The witnesses stated that they approach Vessel 1 in their vessel and observed the operator in the water hanging onto the side of Vessel 1. 

Witnesses said that Operator lifted himself back into Vessel 1 and proceeded to navigate in an unsafe manner heading west in the Intra-Coastal Canal, at a high rate of speed. Witnesses then stated that they heard what sounded to be Vessel 1 outboard motor come completely out of the water and rev up to high RPMs. Witnesses stated that they again observed Vessel 1 operating in a circular manner. Witnesses again approached Vessel 1 and observed Operator in the water hanging onto the side of Vessel 1 that had run aground. 

Witnesses stated that they could tell that Operator was injured and offered to help him. Witnesses boarded Vessel 1 and turned off the engine that was still in gear. Operator began to cuss at the witnesses and told them to leave. The witnesses then got back into their vessel and pulled away from Vessel 1 to avoid any conflict, and then proceeded to call 911. The witnesses then navigated to River's End boat ramp were a Brazoria County Sheriff's Deputy boarded their vessel, and was taken to Vessel 1. Operator was then loaded into witnesses' vessel and taken back to River's End boat ramp, where EMS was waiting. Operator was transported to Brazosport Regional Hospital. 

Operator sustained serious injury to his left leg, due to Vessel 1 outboard motor propeller striking him after he was ejected from his vessel. Upon my investigation of Vessel 1, I observed one half full opened beer can, no life jackets or fire extinguisher were onboard. The accelerator was still in gear. The damage to Vessel 1 included a broken steering cable, and the leaning post was ripped from the floor. Vessel 1 was turned over to Operator's next of kin after the investigation. 

Upon interviewing Operator at the Brazosport Regional Hospital, I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Operator. I ask Operator if he would submit to a blood test to determine his blood alcohol content. Operator stated that he would rather not.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Once he got under way the conditions got very bad.  As he neared Cottonwood he tried to tie up the dock.  The wind caught the boat and lifted it onto it's side almost to a 90 degree angle.  This caused the children to be thrown against the railing.  At the same time his battery was submerged in water and the boat quit running.  He was about twenty to fifty feet from the shore so he told the kids to jump, which they did.  They were pulled in by people on shore. 
He drifted away but was able to get the boat started and went back towards the marina.  When I arrived on the scene I saw the front of his boat come out of the water eight to ten feet.

The sheriff’s deputy informed me that life flight had been launched and that they were approximately 10 minutes from the scene. I notified another game warden about the incident and immediately headed to Alcova Reservoir. Upon arrival it was learned that the life flight medics had just left with the injured boy. It was described that he had a severe laceration to his leg. Upon getting briefed by the officers on scene, myself and officer2 began conducting interviews of the operator and other nearby witnesses. Our first interview was the operator. Operator stated that he was pulling some children in the water towards the small island off the shore when one of the children (his grandson) lost his grip off the bow of the boat and floated back and became stuck in the propeller. Operator stated that the children were in the water hanging onto the boat as he was driving them to the island.

He stated that there were two juvenile females hanging onto bumpers tied to the bow and that the boy was hanging onto the trolling motor that was also mounted on the bow.  After reversing out approximately 100'-120', Operator turned his boat so that he could drive the kids in towards the island.  The point when he turned the boat is when it is believed that the young boy lost his grip.  At this point, the boat continued turning and the stem of the boat was now adjacent to the boy in the water.  When Operator engaged the throttle to move forward, the boy got sucked into the prop and became injured and stuck.  

Operator stated that he was unaware that the boy had lost his grip and he believed that he had hit a rock when the boy was struck.  Once he recognized that he had struck the boy and that he had become stuck, Operator screamed for help and he entered the water to help the boy. Upon hearing his screams, 3 other individuals from separate parties entered the water to assist too. The boy's leg had become lodged in the prop and Operator and one of the witnesses used a knife to cut the tangled swim suit off the boy, freeing him. Once free, the injured boy was loaded onto a waiting jet ski and taken to shore. Once arrived on shore, multiple people worked to stop the bleeding; shirts were used as makeshift tourniquets.  Once the deputies arrived on scene, trauma gauze and a proper tourniquet were utilized.  Once life flight arrived, the boy was evacuated and taken to Casper.

Given the facts gained from speaking with witnesses it was determined that the operator in this case was directly responsible for this accident.  Had he not allowed the children to ride on the bow, this accident would not have occurred.  By do so, he was reckless in his operation of the watercraft and was changed with such.

Burnet County Dispatch informed me to respond to 108 Vista Verde in the Buena Vista Subdivision on Inks Lake.  Dispatch informed me that both jet ski operators were at that location.  Upon arrival, I met with both operators and they were identified as 23 year old Operator1 and 16 year old Operator2.  I spoke with Operator2 and he informed me they were both operating in open water at the mouth of the cove from where the owner of the jet ski's lake house is.  Operator2 stated he was travelling Southbound at approximately 20-25 MPH about 75 yards from the shore.  He stated he looked up and Operator1 was operating the other jet ski at a high rate of speed and was coming right at him.  Operator2 stated Operator1 swerved at the last second and struck the right (starboard) side of his jet ski with the right (starboard) side of Operator1's jet ski.  Operator2 said it was a glancing collision and they both were thrown from their jet ski, however, neither was injured.  I observed considerable damage to the starboard side of Operator2's jet ski and it was inoperable.

I then met with Operator1 and he stated they were both operating at the mouth of the cove and he stated he was travelling Northbound at approximately 40-45 MPH.He thought Operator2 was entering the cove, rather than continue Southbound,  and was unable to avoid a collision and struck the right side of Operator2's jet ski.  Operator1 also stated he broke the steering mechanism during the collision when he was thrown off.  I observed damage and paint transfer under the rub rail on the starboard side of Operator1's jet ski.  Operator1 stated that the collision was his fault and he said he would take full responsibility.  

Operator2 and Operator1 were escorted back to the lake house they were staying at which was 113 Cole Circle.  I obtained a voluntary written statement from Operator1 at that time.  

On 6/26/17 I made contact with the original complainant.  I asked him if I could meet with him and met him at his lake house on Inks Lake.  He informed me that he and his girlfriend both witnessed the jet ski accident.  They both stated that the 2 jet skis that collided along with a third jet ski were operating extremely dangerous.  They said they were operating at high rates of speed, circling one another and spraying one another.  They also stated it appeared they were playing ""chicken"" with one another and driving directly at each other and then swerve at the last minute and spray each other.  They said they were watching them because they were being so dangerous and they thought they were going to cause an accident.  They stated the black/yellow jet ski being operated by Operator1 was clearly the aggressor.  They stated the black/yellow jet ski was being operated at a high rate of speed and was going directly at the other one and said it went too close to the other jet ski and struck it. They stated both were ejected from their jet ski and then they lost sight of them.  They provided me with a Voluntary Written Statement.  

Operator1 was issued a citation for Violation of the 50 foot rule and for No Boater Education.

I responded to Lake Hampton where emergency personnel were beginning to stage near the boat ramp.  

It was reported to me that a fisherman had overheard someone calling for help and trolled to the area and found a small boat with the trolling motor still on going in circles near the south bank of the dam.  I located the witness and identified him.  

Witness stated he had heard someone calling for help across the lake but by the time he got to the location, he could not find anyone but found a boat with the trolling motor still on, going in circles.  Witness wrote a statement which is included in this report.  Yadkin County Sheriff's Deputy towed the boat back to the dock and secured it at that location.  The boat was found to have no visible damage.  

The boat was registered and current (NC3984EC).  I met with Yadkin County Park Director and he decided to close the park to help with the investigation.  Once the public was out of the park and all other boaters accounted for, a white Ford F150 truck was located in the parking lot and found to be registered.  

Preliminary investigation reports indicated that Subject was missing and possibly the person who was calling for help out on the lake.  Lewisville Fire Department responded with a sonar and dive team personnel to assist with the search.  A search was conducted on the water in the location in which the boat was found.  At approximately 06:00 PM, the dive team found a bait casting fishing rod that appeared to have been dropped in the water very recently. The search team had located in the area which the sonar was showing an image of what appeared to be a body in the search area.  The search was suspended at or around 08:30 PM.  The search was restarted at approximately 07:00 AM on 4/15/2017.  Subject's body was recovered at approximately 11:00 AM in the same general area that the boat was recovered.  The recovery was made approximately 15 yards from the lake edge in approximately 16 feet of water.  Subject was wearing a Bass Pro T Shirt, Jean Shorts and tennis shoes.  The body had no visible injuries.

My investigation and findings of this incident indicates Subject, who was known to fish Lake Hampton had arrived sometime Friday morning on 4/14/17 to go fishing.  At approximately 09:30 AM on 4/14/17, Subject fell overboard while his trolling motor was running.  He was not wearing his PFD which was found in his boat, and by all indications was unable to re-board his boat or swim and drowned due to his circumstances.

As V1 reached the 300 foot buoy line, victim Occupant2 released the tube (Airhead Matrix V2) and began feeding out rope.  V1 was traveling at or near idle speed as the rope was nearing its full length.  The PWC struck either a large wave or a boat wake which caused the victim Occupant2 to fall off the rear of the machine, into the water.  When this happened the tow rope became tangled around the forearm of Occupant2's left arm.  

Passenger informed Operator that Occupant2 had fallen off.  At this time Operator, not knowing the rope was around Occupant2's arm, throttled forward in a circular pattern in an effort to come back and pick up the victim. As the machine powered forward it appears the rope tightened around the forearm of the victims left arm and cut through the tissue DE gloving the arm to the wrist joint where the hand was then amputated by the force of the rope pulling. The victim also had a rope burn across his left armpit and shoulder. Upon return of V1, the injuries of the victim were discovered and the victim was assisted up onto the PWC and driven back to the dock where 1st aide was given & 911 was called.  All 3 individuals were wearing life jackets.

Subject provided me with a phone number of one of the people at the boat which I called.  

I spoke with subject2 who stated the boat had a large hole in the bottom of it because they hit either a stump or rock going into the quarry.  Subject2 stated the boat was close to shore and resting on a rock ledge.  Subject2 also informed me everyone was on shore and safe and there were no injuries to anybody.  I advised Subject2 I was on my way.

While responding, I contacted Park Ranger who had arrived at the rock quarry.  Ranger stated the boat was mostly sunk and he had loaded the driver of the boat who was Operator into his truck to go get Operator''s truck and trailer.  Ranger stated there was no alcohol involved.  I then contacted dispatch and had them page the Butler County rescue squad and advised them they needed to bring a boat and their pump.

I arrived on scene at 2015 hours.  I observed a vessel on the north side of the quarry which was mostly submerged.  I pulled up to the boat and spoke with the passengers who were on shore and again verified nobody was injured.  I asked Subject2 to explain what happened and Subject2 stated they were pulling into the quarry when they felt the boat hit on something under the water.  Subject2 stated the boat immediately began filling with water and they hurried to get the boat close to shore.  Subject2 stated when they got close to shore, everybody got out and the boat continued to fill with water.  I remained on scene until the rescue squad arrived.

Once the rescue squad arrived, they used the pump to get the boat floating to a level in which it could be towed.  I then hooked onto the boat with a tow rope and while 2 members of the squad remained in the boat to pump, I towed the boat to Sail boat cove to the boat ramp.  When we got to the ramp, I saw that Operator was there with his trailer in the water.  We loaded the boat onto the trailer and pulled it up the ramp.  When the boat was out of the water, water dumped out of a hole on the stern area of the boat.  The hole was about the size of a softball.  I spoke with Operator about what happened and he gave the same statement as Subject2 did.  I collected the information from Operator for the accident report and cleared the scene at approximately 2200 hours.

I arrived on scene by vessel at approximately 1620 hours.  I observed a silver 20 foot pontoon boat (FL3419PZ) that had 60 horse power mercury outboard motor.  The motor had been burned to the point that a lot of the components were melted together (see attached photos).  The vessel was registered to Wild Life Watersports and the manager of the livery was on scene assessing the damage.  

Manager advised me that the damage appeared to be $8200.  Manager state that he had just spend approximately $3000 in repairs for the outboard motor.  He stated that Marine Max had done a lot of work to the motor and this was the first time the vessel had been in the water since the repairs.  

Manager provided me with the renters’ information who were no longer on scene.  I conducted a vessel safety inspection and found all required safety equipment.  I found that the fire extinguisher had been used but the gauge still read full.  I tested the fire extinguisher but there was no pressure.

I had Operator and Occupant come back to the scene.  Operator stated that the vessel engine was having trouble staying started.  He stated the motor sounded like it was not running right.  Operator was trying to start the engine for the third time within approximately 20 minutes when he heard a boom.  At this point Operator stated that he could smell fuel and stopped trying to start the motor.  

The motor started smoking and then flame started to come out of the top.  Operator found the fire extinguisher and tried to put the fire out.  The fire extinguisher only worked for a very short time.  The fire extinguisher was not effective at putting the fire out.  Operator stated that the rental company came out and picked them up in another vessel.  I spoke with Occupant separately and she stated the same chain of events.  


I went to Wild Life Watersports and made contact with the owner of the livery.  I received a copy of the contract that Operator and Occupant signed (see attached).  I conducted a livery inspection and found that the renters were not given adequate pre-ride instructions on the local surroundings (327.54(1)(e)), including but not limited to manatee zones.

Once on scene I spoke with the boat operator who stated that a juvenile female had fallen while water skiing and was complaining of a headache and was possibly being transported to University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Chestertown for a concussion. 

 Operator stated that at approximately 1430 hours Victim had been waterskiing. At that time, she fell into the water. When Operator checked on Victim she was complaining of a headache. Victim was brought on the boat and asked if she wanted to go to shore. Victim stated she was ok for the time being. Operator then allowed another juvenile to ski, once she was completed Victim requested to be taken to shore. Once on shore a member of the Wellness Center responded to take her to the Center. Victim was observed for two hours and still complained of a headache. Victim’s parents instructed the Wellness Center to wait a few more hours to see if she developed any more symptoms prior to going to the hospital. 

 At approximately 2100 hours I responded to the hospital to speak with Victim, as she was being brought in. Victim was complaining of a headache, dizziness, and nausea. Victim explained that while she was skiing she was wearing a personal flotation device and a helmet. Victim struck a wave and was unable to maintain her balance and fell towards the water. During her fall the helmet, which was too big, fell in front of her face. Victim fell face first into the water, the helmet was subsequently pushed back on to the top of her head. Victim stated that she remembers falling into the water but not resurfacing, but doesn’t believe that she lost consciousness. Victim’s head began hurting at that time, she attempted to stay on the vessel as another female went skiing. That is when Victim stated she requested to be taken ashore. Victim was later taken to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Chestertown to be seen for a possible concussion. She had not seen the doctor when I left.

According to Operator1, he was entering the marina in his vessel (V1) for an overnight stay.

     I arrived on the scene at 2:15PM and made contact with the bridge tender, who witnessed the accident. Witness1 stated that a sailing vessel named Wind Dancer (white, 1988 Pearson, Doc#936298) struck the bridge while passing through and had broken a navigational light attached to the bridge. After being struck, the navigational light broke free from the bridge and remained attached only by a single cable. Witness1 stated that after the collision he repeatedly attempted to make contact with the vessel via the VHF radio but all of his attempts went unanswered. The Wind Dancer failed to stop and continued on into the Chester River traveling in the direction of Rock Hall. Officer attempted to catch up with the vessel but was unable to do so due to inclement weather. Corporal, who also heard the call over the radio, was waiting at Rock Hall marina in case the vessel returned to Rock Hall. 

     With the information given by Witness1, I found that the Wind Dancer was a rental vessel and was rented out by Haven Charters of 20846 Rock Hall Avenue in the town of Rock Hall in Kent County, Maryland. I made contact with a representative for Haven Charters who stated that they were unaware of the accident and the vessel was rented out and due to return within the hour. I relayed this information to Corporal who traveled to Haven Charters to wait for the vessel to return. 

     The vessel arrived at Haven Charters at approximately 4:30PM at which point Corporal made contact with the occupants in order to gather a statement from the individuals on board. The operator of the vessel advised that they had rented the vessel for the weekend to sail to Saint Michaels and on their way back to Haven Harbor they came to the Kent Narrows Bridge. When they arrived at the Kent Narrows bridge they were traveling at approximately two knots, the tide was running northbound and the winds were north to south at approximately 25 knots. 

Operator advised that as they passed under the bridge the stern of the vessel moved to the left toward the bridge wall while the bow moved slightly to the right. Operator then maneuvered the vessel back to operating straight through the channel but the mast brushed against the opened portion of the bridge. Operator advised that he heard some brief metal on metal scraping but it ended quickly and he saw no visible damage to his vessel or the bridge and for this reason he did not stop. Operator stated that he assumed that if there were any damage done to the bridge, the bridge tender would have called him on the phone because that is how they contacted him initially to verify the bridge would be open. Operator’s statement was corroborated by the other three passengers who were adamant that they were unaware that their contact with the bridge had done any damage.  Corporal cleared the scene after getting the written statement from Operator. 

     I contacted Haven Charters again on October 17, 2017 in order to gather the insurance information for the vessel for any repairs to the bridge. This information was passed on to the bridge tender, Witness1, and the Maryland State Highway Administration who had contacted me that morning. The damage was estimated by the State Highway Administration to be $7,500.  
     
     The winds at the time of the accident were 25+ knots out of the north with occasional gusts exceeding 35 knots, the tide was coming in from the Kent Narrows to the Chester River and there was no other boat traffic in the area. No other structures, vessels or property were damaged as a result of the accident.

I received a call from GSP dispatch in reference to person injured from falling off a tube.  The dispatcher advised me the vessel involved was pulling to the dock at the boat ramp at Old Salem Park.  I immediately went to the boat ramp to assist the victim.  

	Upon arrival, I noted there were three female juveniles on the dock. Two of the female juveniles were assisting the victim, which was also a female juvenile.  I noted the victim was shuffling her feet trying to walk.  I advised the two female juveniles assisting the victim to immediately lower the victim to the dock.  I tied my vessel and attended to the victim.  The victim was incoherent and had slurry speech.  Victim appeared to be going in and out of consciousness.  I started to treat the victim for shock while waiting for EMS personnel.  I asked one of the girls what happened.  The female juvenile stated she fell off the tube and she was acting funny when they got her into the vessel.  She stated they immediately started back for the boat ramp and called 911 for an ambulance.  Once EMS personnel arrived on scene, I turned my attention to the vessel and the operator.  The first thing I looked for any evidence of alcoholic beverages in the vessel, which I did not see.  I then talked to the operator who stated she was at the lake with her boyfriend and his two children.  She also had her two children there as well.  The vessel registration was GA 6279 YV, which was a 1998 Blue Bayliner Inboard/outboard.

	I spoke with Operator1.  Operator1 identified the tubers as all female juveniles.  I did not detect an odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Operator1.  EMS personnel stated the victim needed to be transported to Athens Regional Medical Center immediately.  I advised Operator1 to contact the victim’s mother and advise her what was happening.  At the time there was no number for the victim’s mother and Operator1 did not have her cell phone. I advised Operator1 I would interview everyone at a later time.  Victim was transported to Athens by the medical unit.  It should be noted Operator1 accompanied the victim in the ambulance. 

When I arrived at Athens Regional hospital, I met with Dr.  Dr. stated that Victim sustained a concussion and had fluid in her left lung.  Dr. stated she was in stable condition but wanted to keep Victim overnight for observation.

I interviewed Operator1.  Operator1 stated she was pulling the tube and was causing the tube to go over the wake of the vessel.  Operator1 stated one of the girls fell off the tube which caused it to be uneven weight wise.  Operator1 stated the tube went airborne and flipped landing on top of the other two tubers.  Operator1 stated she turned around and picked up the tubers in the water.  Once she got the girls in the boat, she noted Victim was crying stating her head hurt and decided she needed to be seen by medical personnel.  

I obtained witness statements from everyone in the vessel and on the tube.  The witness statements corroborate the operator’s account of what happened.  No charges were filed in the incident and a boating incident report was completed.

On 05/28/2017, at about 04:30 p.m., these vessels were operating in Puget Sound, 2-3 miles South of West Point Lighthouse, located near Seattle, WA in King County.  
 
According to the Operator of V2, he was sailing on this date and time with 5 adults and 3 children on board the vessel.  The wind was coming out of the North at about 15 knots with gusts in the 18 range.  They were a couple of miles off of Discovery Park in Seattle.  There was some commercial traffic ahead – a tug and barge and a cruise ship leaving Seattle.  His vessel was just outside the shipping lane when he decided to come about and head back north to their home port, Shilshole Mariana.  
 
Operator2 reported that there were a couple of boats north of them but a ways out and coming in their direction.  His vessel was pinching to the wind trying to stay out of the shipping lane and the tug traffic.  They were sailing on a starboard tack.  About 4 or 5 minutes later a boat (V1) stuck the port side of his vessel.  
 
V1 was on a port tack so their high side hit the low side of V2 knocking over a couple of the stanchions that was holding their life line.  The impact bent most of the stanchions on the port side and broke off the life line.  According to Operator2, as V1 went by they noticed that there were about 8 people on board.  They appeared to have drinks in their hands.
 
Based on the damage, Operator2 pulled V2 up into the wind, started the engine and assessed the damage.  V1 came back up and someone on board yelled at V2 to “be careful” and turned and headed back south.  V2 pulled the sails to avoid any further damage and motored up to Shilshole.

Guide immediately turned around and went over to the two people in the water. Occupant climbed onboard PWC and a nearby vessel towed V1, with Operator onboard, the approximate 200 yards back to the marina. 


Operator made impact with the PWC causing a laceration to his chin, a loose tooth, and bruising to his ribs. Occupant suffered some bruising to the buttocks.

During this time, V2, a 22’ sailing vessel (FL5477NU), had just exited the marked channel of Ponce De Leon boat ramp and was headed west under sail power. The vessel did have an auxiliary outboard motor equipped but it was in the up-right and stored position at the time of the collision. 
At approximately 1230 pm, Operator2 became aware that V1 was on a collision course with his own vessel. Operator2 advised V1 was approximately 200 yards from his position at that time. Operator2 stated he immediately turned hard to port to avoid a collision. He was unsuccessful. V1 was travelling at approximately 10 knots and impacted V2 directly astern causing a “V-shaped” indentation in V2s transom near the auxiliary motor mount. The force of the impact caused V2 occupant to fall forward, off the bench seat, hitting the seat across from him. V2 occupant suffered injuries to his arm and leg. 
After interviewing Operator1, he stated that a combination of ocean spray on the wind shield and the Sun had obstructed his vision. Also, moments before the collision, Operator1 was distracted by a “beeping” alert from his console. He admitting he was looking down at his electronic instruments at the time of the collision. The beeping alert was later determined to be the GPS unit losing satellite connection. Operator1 advised that he never saw the sailing vessel but was aware of other vessels operating in the area.
V1 sustained minor damage to its bow and had no injuries on board. V2 had damage to its transom and had one, non-life-threatening injuries on board. 
Operator1 was cited for Navigation Rule 5, Failure to maintain Proper Look-out and given a warning for Rule 18, Responsibilities Between Vessel (Powered vessels shall give way to sailing vessels).
V2 occupant sustained injuries to his left leg and right arm. V2 occupant's leg was ""de-fleshed"" approximant 4 inches and will probably need skin grafts to correct. He also had minor cuts on his right arm.

On 12/02/2017 at 16:22 hours I was on patrol at Rush Creek in Perry County with Officer. While on boat patrol we noticed a car parked near the shore where cars are not permitted to park. At the same time Officer spotted a canoe about 200 yards away on the water. At that time I also noticed the canoe. It was unclear to me at the time if the vessel was a canoe. The canoe was sitting very low in the water and from a distance it looked like a raft. It was at that time I could see that there were three people on the canoe. It was also clear that the canoe was in some kind of distress. It also appeared to be stuck on a stump. At that time we witnessed the canoe almost capsize. 
After witnessing the above information we operated our vessel to the canoe and asked if they were okay. I then saw that all three subjects were wet and there was a large amount water in the canoe. Operator 1 was sitting in the far back seat of the canoe advised that they had flipped the canoe and they were having problems getting in. I asked them if they had Life Vest and they advised that they did not. I asked if they had vest before the canoe tipped and they advised they did not.
 The subjects ask for our help but once we tried to assist they advised they were fine and they could paddle to their car. The subjects attempted to paddle to their car and continued to rock and operate in a circle. It was very clear that the subjects were cold and would not make it to their car without assistance. We then pulled our boat next to the canoe. I then took a rope and ran it under the middle seat and back up to our boat where I could stop the canoe from tipping. Officer then slowly towing the canoe to shore. 
Once on shore the subjects were identified. I then asked Operator of vessel 1, to unlock his vehicle, get his friends in the car, and turn on the heat, Operator then said, “No”. I then asked him to do it again and he said, “I’m good”. I could see that the operator of said vessel was not thinking reasonably. All the subjects were shaking, had problems completing simple task, and were slurring their speech. I also noticed the subjects had problems walking. During this time I communicated with dispatch and advised them to send a medic. 
 I explained to the operator that I smelled beer and that I knew he had been drinking. The Operator advised that he had a small amount to drink. The operator was ordered to get in the car and informed that I was not going to charge him with OVI and that I only cared for everyone’s safety. The Operator advised he did not plan to drive his car and he didn’t want to get in trouble. The Operator then followed my directions. I then told the subjects that it may helpful to take their cold coats off and shoes off. They proceeded to take some of their wet clothes off. I also provided them with a blanket from our boat. 
Officer then took the boat back to the patrol truck and responded by land with our patrol vehicle.
While waiting for the medic the subjects advised they took a six pack of beer on the water and that is what they drank. The Operator appeared to be getting better but all the subjects were shaking uncontrollably. All subjects advised they were in the water for approximately hour. 
While talking to the subjects I noticed Occupant 1, was in the back of the car starting to fall asleep. I yelled at occupant 1 to wake up and he responded, “I am only taking a cat nap”. I explained to the subjects that they needed to stay awake and this was a sign of Hypothermia.
When the medic arrived I was struggling to keep Occupant 1 awake. All subjects were then placed in separate medic. 
The Operator provided me with a number for his wife. I then called her and advised her of the situation. The Operator wife advised that she was coming  and we would talk when she got there because she did not wish to sign for the subject. 
I then talked to Officer. I explained that I could not see blood shot or glassy eyes on the subjects. I also explained that the indicators of impairment that I was witnessing were also the indicators of hypothermia. I also advised I could not articulate the difference at that time. 
While taking care of phone calls Officer advised me that occupant 1, was causing a problem form the medics. I was informed that the Chief that was on scene felt that all three subjects needed transported; however they were not cooperating.  I then spoke to Occupant 1, at that time I could see he had blood shot eyes. Occupant 1, did not appear to be making sound decisions. Occupant 1, even mentioned that he was once shot in the head. I explained to Occupant 1, that if he could not provide for his own safety I would take him to jail for not having a life vest and possibly for disorderly conduct, and incapacitated operator . I also explained that he could be arrested for the Life Vest violation that was a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. I explained that he could not drive because he had been drinking and if he went back out in the cold his body tempter would drop again and I would have to call the medic back out. I also explained I had a duty to act and see that he was safe. I also explained that because he did not have a ride and could not provide for his own safety I would have to take him to jail and I would first have to take him to the hospital to be checked out. I explained to Occupant 1,  that if he went with the medic he was providing for his own safety and that he would only get a summons. Occupant 1, then advised the medic that he would go to the hospital with them. 
Officer then had a citation in her hand behind me. I then told Officer that I was not worried about issuing the citation at this time and that our priority was seeing the subjects got checked out and provided for their own safety. 
I then explained the same information to the Operator and Occupant #2. Both subjects advised that they would be going with the medics to be treated. Operator was also advised that his wife was in rout to get the car but it was also unclear if she was an option for his own safety because she appeared to be coming for the car. All three subjects were then transported by ems to Fairfield Medical Center in Lancaster, Ohio. 
After all three subjects were transported I spoke with the Operators wife. The Operator's wife advised she knew that her husband was drunk and that I could put that in my statement. She also said that the Operator is an alcoholic and that he just got his driver’s license back.  The Operator was upset that I did not charge the subjects with any additional charges. I explained that I could not prove what was causing the signs of impairment. When I explained that all three subjects were transported she laughed. I continued to explain that I felt that they were hypothermic and that they were lucky to be alive. 

The Operators wife then arrived to retrieve the car, she was very upset. The Operators wife asked me to search the car so she knew there was not marijuana or other illegal items in the car. During the search a backpack was found with several bottles of alcohol in it. The bag also had wet items that were now trash (from the water) and a small bag of what appeared to be seeds. The Operators wife advised she did not want the bag in the car and asked us to take it. The bag was then collected as evidence. The Operators wife was unable to get the vehicle moved because she did not have a key. The Operators wife advised that she would get it later in the evening and that request was granted. 
Officer and I then responded to Fairfield Medical Center. Upon arriving to the hospital we met all three subjects walking out of the hospital. Upon approaching them the Operator thanked us for , “getting them warm”. I then issued them citations for not having life vest. All subjects were given a court date and advised that the court time was at 9am.",NA,NA,NA,NA

When he passed the first cove north of North Telephone Cove, the engine on the vessel began to sputter and smoke.  He turned the vessel south to head to the beach.  Immediately upon turning south, the engine died and the boat began to drift with the wind.  

OPERATOR told me he got out of the boat and attempted to pull the boat to shore, approximately 200'' swim.  While OPERATOR was pulling the boat, a wave crashed over the transom and the vessel began taking on water.  Within minutes, the bow of the boat began to rise, and OPERATOR knew the vessel would sink.  OPERATOR and the four children, all wearing life jackets, exited the boat and swam to shore.

At approximately 11:00AM the rental boat was checked out and they left the Marina with 3 other occupants.

  Around 12:15PM they returned in their rental boat to the marina and Operator1 was seen driving as she dropped off Subject1 and one other occupant onto the dock. Upon doing so, Operator1 attempted to back the boat away from the dock to turn around. Giving the throttle too much gas in reverse jolted the boat hard in a backward direction prompting her to hastily return the throttle to forward gear. As Operator1 returned the throttle back to forward gear she again gave it too much gas making the boat lunge forward and into the dock creating a substantial commotion and attracting the attention of  several witnesses. 
However, there was no obvious damage to the rental boat or dock from this collision. According to witness statements and security footage, immediately after hitting the dock Operator1 managed to get the boat turned around and began to leave the marina in a very fast manner. By traveling well above the ""No-Wake"" limits within the confines of the marina, Operator1 created a substantial high-wake condition in very close proximity to several moored boats in their slips. 
  This high-wake damaged a boat as it collided with the dock several times bending the bow eye and creating stress fractures in the gelcoat. It also broke a piece off of the trolling motor bracket. 
  
  After leaving Big Bear Resort in the rental ski boat, Operator1 eventually made her way out of Big Bear Creek and turned right on the main lake to head south towards the Bee Spring Lodge/Southern Komfort area. According to witness statements, Operator1 was seen driving the boat above plane ""dangerously"" close to the bank as well as other people. It was at this time at approximately 12:50PM that the rental boat being driven by Operator1 collided with submerged concrete causing extensive damage to the boat. Witnesses were able to identify the boat as a rental belonging to Big Bear Resort. Management from BBR was contacted at roughly the same time advising them of what was just witnessed and employees from the marina were sent out to terminate the rental agreement and retrieve the boat for damage inspection. Shortly thereafter around 1:50PM, Big Bear Resort contacted law enforcement authorities requesting an officer to be en route to their marina for assistance in the manner.",34155,NA,NA,NA

After fishing for approximately 30 mins, Subject along with his passengers noticed a large amount of standing water in the deck of their vessel.  

Subject pulled the anchor and headed towards shore (Topsail Beach) and attempted to run the water out by getting the vessel on plane, but the vessel would not plane out.  As Subject was attempting to navigate the vessel to shore, he lost engine power.  Subject stated that the water in the vessel was causing the engine to become partially submerged under water which is suspected to be the cause of the power loss.   Shortly after losing engine power, a large wave struck the left side of the vessel causing it to turn over.  All seven passengers on board were thrown into the water.  After being thrown into the water, the passengers held onto the overturned vessel until the vessel drifted near shore where several bystanders on the beach were able to assist them to shore.  The passengers were in the water for approximately 20 mins before the bystanders on the beach were able to assist them.

A passenger on the boat, stated a large amount of water was coming over the stern of the vessel while it was anchored.  It is not known if this was the only cause of the water in the boat, but it is suspected to be a contributing factor.

The vessel sustained approximately $8500.00 in damages.

A passenger on the vessel, was transported to the hospital as a result of the accident. Subject was issued a citation for having a child on board under 13 years of age who wasn't wearing a personal floatation device.

Osage County Sheriff''s Office had contacted Lt. after they received a call about a missing person on a private watershed lake, known as Lyndon City Lake. The lake is owned by the father of the victim. Lake owner has a cabin located on the west side of the lake. At approximately 11:42 p.m. on September 23, Lt. called Officer and informed him to disregard and that they had found the victim. When Officer and Lt. were contacted it was not mentioned that the incident had been a boating accident, just a missing person on the water. 

On Sunday, September 24, 2017, Officer was informed that the missing person had actually been a boating accident and that the victim had sustained a severe head injury and was transported by Lifestar to Stormont Veil in Topeka to receive treatment. Officer went in to Osage County dispatch to investigate what had happened and retrieve information from the incident. Deputy was the first officer on scene and took the initial report of the incident the night of the 23rd. Deputy also took pictures on the scene after the victim was in route to receive treatment. 

The victim was the sole occupant on the vessel when the incident occurred. Victim appeared to have grounded the Jet Ski on the North end of the lake, along the dam. With the dam having a rock structure, the jet ski appeared to have come in contact with the rocks, causing Victim to be ejected to the west side of the jet ski. Victim then appeared to have struck her head on the rocks and sustained a severe head injury to the back of her head. The Jet Ski was found on its handlebars leaning towards the port side. Most of the damage to the vessel is on the port side indicating that when it struck the rocks, it rolled to the port side, ejecting the victim to the west of the vessel. 

It was reported that the victim had decided to get onto the Jet Ski that was located along the dock near where the group had been located. She started the Jet Ski, took off across the lake, and within minutes, a crash was heard and the victim was heard yelling. After speaking with the reporting party she stated that the victim had been drinking alcohol and that she had only witnessed her drink a couple of drinks. She also stated that Victim was experienced on the Jet Ski and that she operates the vessel on a fairly regular basis.

The victim also stated that she had been drinking wine and palm breeze prior to the incident for her birthday weekend. Victim admitted that she did not remember much of the incident and that it was blurry. Officer sent a voluntary statement form to Victim and instructed her to return it to the Topeka office.

At about 1230 hours, a boater notified me on the marine band radio channel of a PWC towing a person into the marina as they were hanging onto the PWC. The reporting boater was concerned about asphyxiation for the person being towed. 

RESPONSE
I responded by boat to the area and searched for the PWC/person being towed. After a few minutes, I noticed a PWC stopped in the water about 200 yards northeast of the marina so I made contact and found it was likely the PWC reported. There was a male attempting to re-board the PWC from the rear but he was struggling to reach the seat and partially laying on the rear of the PWC in apparent exhaustion.

ASSISTANCE OFFERED
I brought the patrol boat along side the PWC and offered VICTIM the rail of the patrol boat to help stabilize and pull himself up as I held the PWC by it's handle bars. The US Coast Guard Auxiliary arrived at our location and offered to help as VICTIM was pulling himself up onto the seat. Once VICTIM was on the seat, the rear of PWC began to sink and pull away from the patrol boat. As the boats pulled away from each other, VICTIM kept hanging onto the patrol boat rail and subsequently fell back into the water.


As VICTIM fell back into the water, he continued hanging onto the patrol boat with his left hand. The US Coast Guard Auxiliary made their built-in ladder ready and had VICTIM swim to it and board their boat. After VICTIM was on the USCG Auxiliary boat he mentioned that he was unable to use/lift his left arm. I offered to have medical units/EMTs respond to help but VICTIM denied medical assistance. VICTIM said he would find somewhere to get it checked out. We then discussed local options for medical facilities and I gathered some information for report. The operator of the PWC was VICTIM's wife and I believe there was also another female as a passenger on the PWC. The other female was his wife’s daughter. Once VICTIM was on the USCG Auxiliary boat, the two females on the PWC started driving toward the marina to meet with VICTIM on shore.

CONCLUSION
VICTIM concluded that he must have injured his left shoulder when he fell back into the water still hanging onto the patrol boat. The USCG Auxiliary transported VICTIM to the marina pump-out dock where he off-boarded and thanked all for the help.

FOLLOW-UP
Later in the evening of day of incident, I called VICTIM to see if he was able to get checked out at a medical facility. He said he was still planning to get checked out further. I gathered additional information needed for report.

On 9/7/2017, I called VICTIM to get information for the female passenger. He gave it to me and I also found he just returned from an appointment where he learned he will need surgery for the injury.",R881944,NA,NA,NA

The incident occurred at approximately 1125 hours, and involved a 14 foot Raddisson wide transom aluminum canoe, that capsized.  The approximate location on the water where the incident occurred was one-hundred yards north, of the northern bank of West Bank Park.  

On scene, I proceeded to interview the occupants of the canoe, witnesses, and various Forsyth County Public Safety Staff.  I determined that the canoe, powered by a thirty foot/pound thrust trolling motor, capsized due to improper shifting of weight by the two passengers on board.  A 54 year old white male subject, and a 14 year old white male juvenile subject, were on board when the incident occurred.  They both stated that they had been engaged in fishing activity, when too much weight in the canoe abruptly shifted to the port-side, which caused it roll, and capsize.

DNR advised that a vessel was damaged by a large wake thrown by a passing vessel. 

I subsequently made contact with Operator2, herein referred to as Operator2, about this incident. Operator2 advised that his vessel, a 2005 Luhrs sport-fishing vessel, was anchored and tied to another vessel inside of the Sassafras River 6 knot maximum speed zone, when a large wake caused the two boats to crash against one another. Operator2 advised that the violent wave action caused heavy cracking near the inside of his transom, where his vessel was tied off to the neighboring vessel. Operator2 advised that he was able to obtain the offending vessel's owner information. I told him that I would meet him at his boat in the Sassafras River to take the report.

He was anchored about 200 yards into the Sassafras River 6 knot maximum speed zone on the Kent County, MD side of the river. Operator2's vessel was located about 57 yards from the Kent County shoreline. Operator2's vessel would later be fully identified as a 2005 34' Luhrs sport-fishing with Delaware vessel registration number ""6857AK"". Operator2 advised that he renamed the vessel ""Reel Thing"" with a hailing port of ""Newark, DE"" and is in the process of documenting the vessel with the USCG.  I asked Operator2 what happened. He advised that at about 4:10 PM, he was on his boat along with three other people. Operator2 advised that his vessel was tied to his son's vessel, a Silverton cabin cruiser. the Luhrs' port side was tied to the starboard side of his son's Silverton vessel. Both vessels were anchored from the bow, with the bows facing north. Operator2 advised that the vessels had 4 10""x26"" boat bumpers set between the vessels near the bow, midship, and stern. 

     Operator2 advised that just before 4:10 PM, Operator2’s son alerted him to a large wake coming towards them, as it was thrown from a passing Sea Ray vessel that was traveling eastbound in the Sassafras River 6 knot maximum speed zone. Operator2 and Operator2’s son advised that vessel was traveling just north of the middle of the river as it transited. Operator2’s son advised that he was standing on the back platform of his Silverton when he initially saw the Sea Ray. Operator2 and Operator2’s son both advised that the Sea Ray was throwing a 3' tall wake. Operator2’s son advised that it looked like the vessel was traveling at about 10 to 12 knots. Operator2 advised that the vessel was pushing a large amount of water as it traveled, as it was not up on plane. Operator2 advised that the Sea Ray did not slow down and continued to throw the large wake until it was about 500 yards into the speed zone. Operator2 used a dock across the river as a reference point as to where the Sea Ray started to travel slower. Operator2 advised that at the time the Sea Ray threw the large wake it was the only vessel in the area and the only vessel that was traveling east bound in the speed zone. Operator2 honked his Luhrs' horn to try to get the Sea Ray's attention, but it went unnoticed.

     Operator2 and Operator2’s son advised that it took about 1.5 minutes for the wake to reach them from the time they first saw the large wake. Operator2 advised that the vessels rode the large 3' wake as it passed by them. The boats violently crashed into each other. Operator2 advised that after the wake passed, he noticed that the stern line that was securing the vessels together, burned the gel coat from the stress on the line. He saw that the top and inside of gunnel at the transom door was cracked. He located a series of cracks in the gel coat that ran down the inside of the transom to the Luhrs' floor. There were also numerous stress cracks in the gel coat that ran along the floor and ended near a floor cooler hatch. Operator2 estimated the damage to be valued at about $7,000.

     Operator2 showed me the cracks and advised that the cracks in the gel coat were not there before the Luhrs rode over the wake. I examined the cracks and took pictures of the damage. I located an approximate 3"" crack in the top of the gunnel's gel coat, another approximate 4"" crack in the top of the gunnel's gel coat and then an approximate 6"" crack that ran from the top of the gunnel's gel coat and down the inside of the transom's gunnel. I also located numerous stress cracks that ran along the floor near the transom that ended at the floor cooler hatch. 

    Operator2 advised that he quickly untied his vessel and began to pursue the Sea Ray that threw the large wake. Operator2 and Operator2’s son never lost sight of the Sea Ray after they initially saw it throw the large wake. Operator2 advised that he obeyed the 6 knot speed limit while following the Sea Ray. He advised that he followed the Sea Ray all the way to the Sassafras Harbor Marina, where the Sea Ray docked at slip D-30. Operator2 advised that he made contact with the vessel's operator and notified him of the damage that the large wake caused. 

Operator2 advised that Operator1 provided him with his and his boat's information. Operator2 provided this information to me as follows: Vessel: MD 1674 BY, 2000 Sea Ray 340 Sun Dancer named ""STRAY CURRENT II"". Operator2 advised that Operator1 was very apologetic and said that he knew what he did. Operator1 said, ""I knew I was going too fast and making a big wake."" Operator2 advised that they terminated contact on good terms.

    I provided Operator2 with his NRP report number and told him to call me with the value of damage once he gets an estimate for the repairs. I thanked him and cleared from the scene at about 1850 hours.

    I traveled over to the Sassafras Harbor Marina with the intentions of speaking with Operator1. I called Operator1's phone number and spoke to him as I traveled in the Sassafras River. Operator1 advised that he was not at his boat, that was docked at the Sassafras Harbor Marina, but he was at his residence. Being the distance was too great to travel, I opted to interview him over the phone about the incident. Operator1 provided me with his information and advised that he was in fact involved in an incident on the Sassafras River. Operator1 advised that he was operating his Sea Ray vessel east bound in the Sassafras River when he realized that he was gaining on numerous vessels. 

Operator1 advised that his wife was on his vessel at the time. Operator1 advised that he realized that he missed the 6 knot maximum speed buoys and was exceeding the speed limit. He advised that he was traveling at about 12 MPH as he was about 400 to 500 yards into the speed zone. I asked Operator1 about his vessel and what speed it gets on plane. Operator1 advised that his Sea Ray gets on plane at about 21 MPH. Operator1 guessed that his vessel threw a 2' wake at 12 MPH. Operator1 advised that there were other vessels transiting the area at that time, as that is how he realized he was traveling too fast. He advised that the water was very choppy in the speed zone. Operator1 provided me with his vessel's information and advised that he was fairly new to boating. I thanked Operator1 for his cooperation and told him that he could contact Operator2 about the repairs if he wanted to.

Operator1 reported that on Saturday, September 16, 2017 at approximately 10:45 am, he and his wife, were cruising on their PWCS down Core Creek and Adams Creek and eventually reached the mouth of Newport River.  Operator1 reported that he and wife were cruising just to explore new bodies of water.  Operator1 reported that he and his wife were not familiar with the Newport River.  

Operator1 reported that he and his wife had just reached the mouth of the Newport River when he ran his jet ski aground on what he described as a hidden sandbar, traveling at a speed of approximately 30 mph.  Operator1 reported that he had no idea that the sandbar was there because of the choppy water conditions which made the sandbar difficult to see. 

 Operator1 reported that he was ejected over the handlebars of the PWC, hitting his face on the front of the PWC and landing on his head and neck when he came to rest on the sandbar.  Operator1 reported that he was wearing a PFD.  Operator1 also reported that he was not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs.  Operator1 reported that his doctor informed him that he suffered from the following injuries:  A severe concussion, a laceration above his lip for which he received twelve stitches, a sprained neck, a sprained left wrist, a broken nose, and a severely bruised groin area.  Operator1 was able to operate his PWC back to the boat ramp after the incident.  No charges were filed in this matter.  Nothing further at this time.

On 2/18/17 around 0930, I was dispatched to a beached vessel at Hanna Park.   I found Florida vessel FL1024MA washed up on the beach of Hanna Park. I took several pictures of the vessel which are included in this report. My observation of the vessel when I boarded it was the engine compartments and the main forward cabin had water in it. The forward and aft cabin had water in it.  The anchor was missing and the bilge pump switch was off (not saying that it didn't have automatic bilge pump). The vessels position was pointed North and canted to the Portside. 

The owner gave me a written statement which is as follows and a copy has been attached. ""I took my boat out around 12-pm 2/17/17. Was about 4-5 miles offshore. I dropped my anchor and took my paddle board out ( I keep it on the boat). Paddle around for a couple hours and got a mile or 2 away. It started to get dark so I was going back to the boat  to find it was half under water. I had to paddle to shore. By the time I got to shore it was dark. I suspect between 8-10pm. And walked to my friends on A1A for help.""

I asked if he needed anything off the boat and he went to check before the tide moved in. When he returned to my truck he stated ""I didn't know that it had all the water in it"".

He also said that he had only roughly 20 gallons of fuel on the vessel and that he keeps the vessel at Palm Cove Marina.

While en-route to the vessel crash I was contacted by cell phone by Trooper with the Louisiana State Police. Tpr.1 had arrived on scene and advised me that one of the operators had to be transported to Bayne-Jones Hospital located on Ft. Polk. Tpr.1 also advised me that both operators appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and both had admitted to consuming alcohol beverages prior to the crash occurring. Tpr.1 offered assistance by taking one of the operators to the Vernon Parish Sheriff’s Office and offering him the opportunity to provide a valid breath sample into the intoxilyzer 9000. 

Tpr.1 transported Operator1. Once at the V.P.S.O. Operator1 provided a voluntary breath sample of 0.076 g% blood/alcohol content into the intoxilyzer 9000, which is above the legal limit for persons under the age of 21 (see attached supplemental report). The operator of vessel 2 was determined to be Operator2 who was transported to Bayne-Jones Hospital on Ft. Polk for injuries to his left leg that was sustained during the crash, by Acadian Ambulance. 

	Agent and I arrived at Bayne-Jones Hospital and made contact with Operator2. Operator2 was read his MIRANDA warning from my MIRANDA warning card carried in the field. Operator2 was questioned on the causes of the crash. 

Operator2 stated that he and his friend Operator1 had rented two personal watercraft, (P.W.C.) from Sak Pase Rental on this day. While operating them on Vernon Lake they both were making sharp complete circles within close proximity of one another, when he was struck by Operator1 without warning and thrown from the P.W.C. see attached voluntary statement form. Operator2 was then read his rights relating to the chemical test for intoxication form and asked if he would be willing to provide agents with a voluntary blood sample. Operator2 signed the voluntary release form from the blood kit and allowed Bayne-Jones medical staff to obtain the proper amount of blood from his right arm. Once the voluntary blood sample had been taken, medical staff labeled and properly sealed the blood kit and released the sealed kit to myself. Medical staff then took Operator2 back for x-rays and agents departed the hospital. 

	Agent and I then arrived at V.P.S.O. to conduct an interview with Operator1. Once inside V.P.S.O. Operator1 was read his MIRANDA warning form my MIRANDA warning card carried in the field. Operator1 was questioned on the events that caused the vessel crash. Operator1 stated that he and his friends had rented P.W.C.s for the day and while operating them near the spillway on Vernon Lake he and Operator2 was making circles on the water when the two collided and could not remember anymore after that see attached statement form. Operator1 was then properly booked into V.P.S.O. for RS 14:98.6- Operate watercraft while intoxicated underage 1st offense, 14:99- reckless operation of watercraft, and 34:851.36- fail to comply with boating education requirements. 

	After completing our interview with Operator1 we were contacted by Operator2 after he had been released by Bayne-Jones Hospital. We then met with Operator2 to learn of his injuries. Operator2’s left leg had determined by medical staff to only have sustained numerous amounts of small lacerations starting near his knee continuing to his foot. At this time Operator2 was issued citations for RS 14:99- reckless operation of a watercraft, and 34:851.36- fail to comply with boating educations requirements. 

	It was determined that Operator2 and another subject had signed  rental agreements from Sak Pase Rental, LLC, for renting two P.W.C. see attached rental agreements. At the time of the crash, Subject had allowed Operator1 to operate the P.W.C. he had rented. Operator1 and Operator2 were near the spillway of Vernon Lake operating in circles too close for the speed and conditions to one another. 

Operator2 was operating vessel 2 a 2016 Sea-Doo Spark LA- 9322-GE in aggressive hard circles turning towards the right. Operator1 was operating vessel 1 a 2017 Sea-Doo Spark 2 in aggressive hard circles turnings towards his left. As the two was doing so they failed to notice that the vessels had begun operating closer to one another. As V2 was coming through a turn V1 was also coming out of a turn putting V1 bow at V2 stern. 

V1 struck V2 at the stern on the port side with its bow. As V1 struck V2, the bow was lifted as the stern of V2 was pushed downward. V1 traveled approximately 3 ft. along its starboard side before listing to its port side causing the starboard side towards the stern to contact the port side of V2 towards the bow. V1 suffered a severe gash in the hull at the bow and a severe gash at the stern on the starboard side of the hull, minor scuffs and scratches along starboard side. V2 suffered significant damage beginning at the stern on the port side and following the port side to the bow separating the hull from the body. V2 lost the remote steering as it was dislodged from the vessel during the impact. It was determined that both operators had failed to comply with the boating education requirements. It was found that both operators had properly worn a personal flotation device and to have their engine cutoff lanyard attached

As we were coming out of Hurricane Pass, we noticed three boats adrift near Marco Pass. One of the boats waved us down and told us that the two other boats had collided and then left. We made contact with the two boats and observed damage to the gunnel of one vessel (See attached photos). Both vessels were operational and we had them follow us to the nearest shoreline.

During my investigation, I concluded that both vessels were moving in the same direction. V1 was travelling northwest out of Marco Pass to the port side of V2. Due to a fairly strong onshore wind, the tide coming into Marco Pass, and the vessels close proximity to each other, V1’s starboard side collided into V2’s port side gunnel. Both the occupant of V1 and V2 were ejected from the vessels. The occupant of V1 was not wearing a PFD and the occupant of V2 was wearing a PFD. Both occupants climbed back into their respective vessels and sustained minor injuries (see attached photos).  Officer treated a minor scrape on the elbow of the occupant in V2. Other Occupant received minor scratches on his back and refused treatment.; 


Both operators completed statements and agreed not to pursue any charges. No citations were issued.

Both vessels remained seaworthy and were released to the operators.

I arrived at the Burnside Island State Park Ramp at 0600 Hours. I spoke with an off duty Somerset police officer. That is where I learned the two fishermen that were overdue hadn’t  been heard from them in a while and the last location they knew the fishermen was near was the Jamestown area.

At 0605 hours Kentucky state police post 11 were able to contact AT&T and obtain a Ping location on Victim1’s cellular phone near Ramsey’s point area of Wayne County.  I contacted the Wayne County Search and rescue squad through the Wayne County 911 center and requested them to respond to the Ramsey point boat ramp.

While in route to Ramsey point Boat Ramp at 0706 hours Wayne County 911 contacted post and told them they have got a call from someone reporting a possible boating fatality East of Ramsey point. I arrived at 0732 hours and was taken to the accident location by the county Search and rescue squad. 

On location, I noticed a capsized vessel with the passenger on the shoreline being treated by Wayne County EMS and approximately 20 feet away still on the shoreline was the operator that was obviously lifeless. I took statements from the fishermen that found the boat accident. They stated the fog was still heavy on the water and as they approached the capsized vessel they thought it was a log floating in the water. As they went in closer for a closer look they heard a voice saying help. As they approached the shoreline they noticed a male wearing a life jacket floating face down in the water and another male wearing a life jacket halfway in halfway out of the water on the bank. One of fisherman jumped into the water and pulled the victim to the shore and rolled him over and checked for a pulse and could not find one. He then transferred over to the passenger to render aid. The other fishermen called 911 and were told to go to the Ramsey point boat ramp where they were first responders waiting on him to show them where the wreck was.

Victim2 was pronounced deceased on the scene by the Wayne County Coroner's office and the patient Victim1 was transported to the Lake Cumberland regional hospital by the Wayne County EMS then took to the University of Kentucky hospital. 

The vessel Impact location with the bank was N 36 56 39.0 W 84 55 00.5, the patient was located N 36 56 38.3 W 84 54 59.5, and the Victim location N 36.56 38 W 84.54.59. From the point of impact the vessel road the shoreline bank approximately 32 feet. The Patient was approximately 90 feet from the point of impact and the Victim was approximately 112 feet from the point of impact.    

Lake Cumberland Marine assist recovered the white, yellow, and black 19 foot 2006 STRATOS MODEL/294 PRO with 200 horse power mercury. The vessel was taken to the Marine assist Garage.

A 17’ open motorboat occupied only by the operator, lost control and crashed into a tree.  The operator was thrown forward into the console and deck, causing substantial injury to the face and left leg fractures.  The cause of this crash is limited visibility due to weather and a possible medical condition causing the 72 year old operator to lose consciousness.

Upon speaking with Victim he stated that he had been out on the boat since approximately 2:30pm that afternoon. He had not had much fluids or food throughout the afternoon. On his way south on the St. Johns River it had started to rain, causing the windshield of the center console boat to become difficult to see through. While going approximately 25 miles per hour he stood up in an attempt to look over the windshield to see where he was going. At that time he thinks he had passed out causing him to no longer have control of the vessel. He remembers coming to at the last second before making contact with the tree but it was too late. Victim fell to the left of the console after hitting the tree, striking his forehead, face and left leg on the inside of vessel, below the handrail. He was able to get to his cell phone and call his family member for help who was also out on a separate boat on the St. Johns River. The family member found him on the damage boat at the accident site and transported him on their boat to the Ed Stone Park boat ramp.;

Victim was transported to the hospital by EMS and admitted for treatment. His injuries were as follows: laceration to the forehead resulting in sutures, facial orbital fracture on the left side and tibia/fibula closed fracture directly below the left knee.

The boat was tied to the rocks off Pixie Park in about 15ft of water.  The operator told the investigator that he never called 911, even though he had a cell phone, and didn't attempt to get help or go immediately to shore after the crash.  The only paperwork he had for the boat was the title.  

The investigator stated the man was very evasive and didn't want to stay.  He had to advise the operator that he was not free to leave, as they were conducting an investigation and that he was likely going to receive citations.  

St. Helens PD had to be called to assist with watching the operator while the investigator continued his inspection.  The investigator was unable to see any damage to the boat as it was in approximately 15 feet of water.  The operator stated that there was a small 12 volt bilge pump running to keep the water from filling the boat.  The operator also said he did not have an anchor on boat to keep the boat from going into deeper water.  

The investigator asked the operator what he planned on doing with the boat, as he was responsible for removing the boat from the waterway.  The operator said he intended to get back in his boat and continue downriver as soon as law enforcement left.  The investigator advised that the boat was unsafe and his voyage was officially terminated until the boat was safe to operate.  The operator said ""Fuck you, man, this is bullshit.  I'm going to call your boss and my lawyers"".  

The operator was cited for Unsafe Operation and No Boater Education Card and reminded that his voyage was officially terminated and he could go to jail if he chose to ignore the order.  A neighbor came down and gave the man an anchor to keep the boat from going into deeper water.  The Coast Guard was notified of the situation and said they might respond due to the potential environmental hazard if the boat sinks.  The investigator added that he didn't have any options to tow the boat since it was safely secure to shore and it wasn't endangering a life.

The accident involved a large vessel (DO# 929314) versus boat lift. Owner rents a boat slip to the vessel (V1) owner and is known to him. The owner/operator was reported to us as Operator1 and was later identified.

The dock owner described witnessing V1 attempting to undock and leave. However, as the owner untied V1, the current was moving swiftly and pushed the vessel towards the docks boat lift. While this was happening, the only occupant, Operator1 was climbing up the cabin ladder and was unaware of his vessels' drift. Operator1 eventually made it to the controls and throttled forward but not in time to avoid a collision. V1 slammed into the boat lift on the corner of its starboard-side and the stern. (see diagram)

Owner attempted to wave Operator1 back to dock but was ignored. Owner then called Operator1 by phone. Operator1 denied hitting anything and refused to return to the accident scene. Owner photographed V1 as it left the scene of the accident.

V1 was located at anchor just outside of Alligator Bay with one occupant on board, later identified as Operator1. Operator1 denied hitting anything but fresh damage was found at the starboard-stern of the vessel with pieces of wood imbedded into the rub rail screws. Damage to V1 was consistent with eye witness accounts of the accident. (see pictures)

V1 has minor damage to the starboard-stern corner of the fiberglass hull and rub rail. The boat lift piling is damaged below the waterline and will probably need to be replaced.

Operator1 was also found to be intoxicated and was subsequently arrested for Boating Under the Influence and Leaving the Scene of an accident. Operator1 was also cited for USCG Rule 5 failure to maintain proper lookout and for Expired registration for his vessel. (see attached Incident Report)",FWSW17OFF011786,NA,NA,NA

Warden further advised that Bell Co. had already dispatched Morgan's Point Resort marine unit to respond to the area.  At approximately 0000hrs Warden contacted the MP marine unit who advised that he was getting in their boat and responding.  Warden advised to contact him back once on scene with an update.  

At approximately, 0019hrs, Warden was en route to Live Oak park where the MP marine unit would be bringing the 7 occupants of the vessel.  Once on scene Warden determined that there was a total of seven people in the vessel and all where ok and accounted for.  There were 2 adult females, 2 adult males, and three juveniles on board the vessel at the time of the accident.

Warden interviewed all adult occupants of the vessel separately and determined that the owner operator of the vessel that night had launched the boat that evening around 1600hrs, tubing sight saw, and recreated that evening.  At approximately 2300hrs they determined that it was time to head back in to the Post oak boat ramp, where they were camping.  They left from around the main lake.  As they got to the mouth of Arrowhead park Operator was plowing through the water and throttled down.  As he throttled down the vessel took a nose dive, water came over the bow of the vessel swamping the boat.  In Warden opinion and from statements of other occupants Operator then throttled up the vessel attempting to get the nose back up, but that caused the boat to torpedo down further in the water, having the reverse effect.  

The vessel then began to list and roll.  All occupants jumped out of the vessel and into the water.  

From statements made by the occupants of the vessel and after speaking with a certified boat mechanic it is believed that the main shaft seal was bad causing the boat to take on water with out the occupants being aware of the issue.

Springfield Fire was requesting a DNR officer to assist with sonar search. At approximately 2:45 PM I arrived to the cove immediately to the west of Lincoln Memorial Garden and Nature Center at Lake Springfield with side scan sonar. When I arrived several other agencies were already on scene searching for the victim and interviewing witnesses. The primary investigating agency up until this point was Springfield Police Department. Divers from SFD and ESDA were also on scene and in the water. CWLP Lake patrol and Springfield PD Lake Patrol were also there assisting in the search. 

I first spoke with Springfield Fire Department to get updated information of what exactly happened and where the witnesses were located. Springfield Firefighters told Intern and I the victim jumped or fell off the boat into the water. SFD said all boat occupants were taken from the scene to an unknown location. I received conflicting reports from SPD about the location to where the victim entered the water. I called ISP Communications to have SPD bring all witnesses back to the scene. 

Intern and I first interviewed Subject1 stated a total of 4 occupants were onboard at the time Victim entered the water including Victim. The other three witnesses were swimming in the water. Subject1 stated at approximately 12:50 PM Victim was bent over to pick something up approximately midship on the port side when Victim jumped/fell out of the port side door/gate. 

Subject1 stated he was the renter/operator of the boat but no one was operating the vessel at the time Victim entered the water. Subject1 stated the boat was drifting in the cove at the time Victim entered the water. We took Subject1 out on the boat and marked 4 different points. The weighted average between the 4 points Subject1 gave was approximately near the location of GPS coordinate of 39.697182, -89.600397. Subject1 stated he called 911 approximately 2 minutes after Victim entered the water and did not resurface. This is where we began our side scan sonar search. 

At approximately 4:02 PM Intern and I then interviewed subject2 who was according to SPD, was the most sober and alert of the occupants. We picked Subject2 and the Springfield Fire Chief up from the shore and them out to what he believed to be the last known location of Victim. 

Subject2 stated somewhere between 1-1:15 PM (911 call was at 1:08 PM) the victim fell out of the boat into the water from the platform up near the bow of the boat. Subject2 did not see Victim fall in the water but heard the splash (Subject1 witnessed the jump/fall from the vessel). Subject2 said Victim was the most intoxicated of all the occupants. Subject2 otherwise corroborated much of the same story as Subject1. Subject2 stated after Victim entered the water he attempted two dives to find Victim. Victim stated by the second dive, Subject1 had already called 911. 

Subject2 stated after the second dive he exited the water back into the boat and spoke to first responders. Subject2 stated he was operating the boat prior to stopping the boat in the cove to swim. We made a couple passes near where Subject2 believe the boat to be at the time Victim entered the water and marked it with a buoy. The approximately average weighted GPS location between the two waypoints was located at 39.697811, -89.600534. Subject2 provided us with a written statement of his account of the event. 

We then escorted Subject2 and the Springfield Fire Chief back to shore. I received information of our trained Sonar Operator had arrived to the CWLP…",2017-4-485-010B,39.69,-89.6,C

I received a call from Dispatch reference a complaint of a boating incident that occurred at Port Royale Marina at approximately 1805 hours.  I proceeded to Port Royale, near the Gas Docks, and met with the two witnesses who had reported the incident.  

The witnesses advised they saw a white in color Star Craft Open Motor Vessel attempt to undock from a slip near the Gas Docks at approximately 1805 hours.  The Star Craft was being operated by an adult white male subject according to the witnesses.  The operator of the Star Craft allegedly struck a blue in color Monteray open motor vessel.  The Monteray was allegedly docked at the time of the incident, in a slip directly next to Star Craft.  According to the witnesses, the Star Craft struck the Monteray's rear starboard- side, with it's rear starboard-side.  According to the witnesses, the Monteray was unoccupied at the time of the incident, and the operator of Star Craft obviously knew a collision occurred, but left the scene immediately.  The operator did not return to the scene.  The witnesses took a picture of the Star Craft, but the picture was of poor quality.  Virtually no identifying information could be obtained from the picture, nor surveillance footage from the Marina.  The witnesses did not know who the owner of the Monteray was.  

	I thanked the witnesses for contacting authorities, and they each provided me with a written statement.  I determined that the Monteray had sustained damage consistent with what the witnesses reported.  I then documented the scene, and noted that paint, body, and emblem damage occurred to the Monteray.  I determined who the owner of the Monteray was and made contact with him by phone. He advised that he was unaware that the incident had occurred.  He also advised that he had not been in the area when the incident occurred, and was in Atlanta.  The damage to the Monteray appeared to be approximately $2000 worth.  He thanked me for contacting him.  

	After conducting an investigation to determine who the operator of the Star Craft may have been, I was unable to identify, or locate the subject.

I then went back in service.

A full report was done on this; however, it was lost when it was submitted to the server. The details of the incident are from witness accounts and what I could remember On June 23 2017, 

On June 23 2017 at approximately 1100 hours myself and Ranger received a report that a wave runner was hit by a brown and white ski boat, and that it had left the scene of the accident. The boat was last seen leaving the main boat dock in Bullfrog marina heading towards Halls Creek Bay. We went down to the dock to make contact with the operator of the wave runner who reported the accident to gather further information so we could try to find the boat that hit the wave runner.  

The National Park Rangers talked with the operator of the wave runner before we arrived. He stated he had no serious injury, but that his knee was sore. He stated that he and another wave runner were leaving Halls Creek Bay with a house boat entering on his port left side. They slowed down to let the houseboat pass them. as soon as they slowed down they said a brown ski boat tried to shoot the gap in between them and the house boat. He was struck by the front of the ski boat. 

We decided to start our search in Halls Creek Bay because the accident occurred  at the mouth of the bay and the boat appeared to be heading back in the same direction. We headed out on our patrol boat after our conversation with Operator2 . Once we got to Halls Creek Bay we started looking for the red and white Chris Craft Boat along the shore. several minutes into or search up the bay we spotted the suspected boat in a small cove anchored to a houseboat. 

We pulled up to the houseboat and talked to the owner of the boat and asked him if he was driving at the time of the accident. He informed us that he was not, his dad was driving. We asked to talk to him. Operator1 confessed to hitting the wave runner while exiting Halls Creek Bay to the main channel. He stated the wave runners were in front of him as a house boat approached on his port left side. The rocky shore was to his starboard right side. has he was looking to his right to make sure he had enough room to clear the rooks he said he looked and the wave runners were stopped and he hit them with port side bow before he could stop his boat. He stopped and asked if everyone was okay then left to go to the Bullfrog Mariana. 

We asked him why he did not wait for law enforcement to take a report when he got to the marina and he stated he did not feel the accident was worth reporting. We had him and his passenger fill out witness statements. We cited Operator1 with leaving the scene of an accident. 

The information is limited due to the fact that I had write the report a second time several months after the accident occurred.

Operator told me he had taken several people (total of 12, 6 adults and 6 juveniles) out on his boat to cruise and go to dinner.  They were returning from dinner at Marina Jacks, traveling north in the Inter Coastal Waterway (ICW) nearing red marker 40, just southeast of Jewfish Key. At approximately 2015 hours, they encountered a large barge that was taking up much of the channel.  As he approached, he brought his vessel down to an idle behind the barge.  He slowly closed the distance between the two and one of the subjects on board the barge told him to pass to their left, but to stay close because the channel was narrow.  Once Operator was clear of the barge, he began to throttle up in an attempt to get back on plane.  When he did this, Operator told me that he was temporarily unable to see in front of him because his bow was too high in the air.  He momentarily lost sight of the nearest red channel marker (#40).  As the vessel began to plane, he was able to see once again and immediately realized that he was on the wrong side of the channel marker.  Operator quickly pulled back on the throttles in an attempt to stop but at that same moment, the vessel ran aground.  They quickly came to rest on a sandbar and several subjects lost their balance and were thrown to the deck.  Two subjects were thrown into an open forward hatch and down a set of steps.  It was clear they had sustained injuries and Operator's wife quickly called 911.  An EMS/fire rescue boat was the first vessel to respond and transported the two subjects to shore for treatment.  The remaining subjects were taken to shore by Boat U.S. afterward. 

The following day, I was able to speak with Operator regarding his boat.  He told me that he did not believe that his vessel had been damaged at all.  I also spoke with both subjects about their injuries.  Occupant1 had sustained multiple facial/orbital fractures to her right eye as well as a laceration to her right eyelid.  She was told it would not need surgery and would heal on it's own.  Occupant2 suffered a chest contusion that would not need further treatment either.

This caused an overload situation on one side and the pedal boat tipped, dumping them both into the water.  Neither one had life jackets on and it was unclear if they had been given them when they rented the boat.

When both men's boats ended up next to each other Operator1, thinking that a collision was imminent, made a sharp right hand turn and when he did the angle of his stern changed so much that both boat's sterns collided together. Both boats stopped and made sure everyone was alright, then continued fishing the tournament.

Dispatch advised of no injuries, and a pontoon had hit a private dock causing damage to the dock, their pontoon, and a pontoon that was docked in a slip. I contacted the caller who reported the accident and asked him a location of the accident. Subject stated that two other property owners had come down to check on him and his wife, and they have already contacted the dock / pontoon owner to inform him of what happened.

I arrived at 15:46; Subject1 and subject2 were sitting on their pontoon waiting. I began to gather identification of both parties and the tag information for both vessels. Subject1 began to explain the accident, while I was gathering information and taking video of the accident site. They were traveling west on Rough River lake trying to run the old gas out of the tank. Subject2 stated she could smell gas coming from the stern of the vessel. While Subject2 was up looking for the possible gas leak, Subject1 (who was operating the vessel) turned around to also look for the possible gas leak. Just when Subject1 turned back around to face the bow, he saw the dock and knew it was too late to steer away. 

I asked Subject1 how fast he thought he was traveling, and he stated that he was between 4,000 - 4,300 RPMs. I asked him if he thought it was roughly between 35-40MPH and Subject1 said it sounded pretty close to how fast he was going. I took body cam footage of both pontoons and their damage, along with the damage to the dock.

I told them about the boat accident report, and told them that if their insurance company needed the report to contact our Headquarters. I provided Subject1 with my cell number, Headquarters number, and the CAD number for a reference. I wrote the same information down on a piece of paper and left it on the front door of owner’s home.

Subject1's pontoon had damage to the front starboard side toon, just below the navigation light. The dock had damage to the side facing the main lake, where the pontoon made contact, and about 3 or 4 boards had been broken due to the impact (one of which had the cleat that was holding other boat owner’s pontoon on the port side). The finger of the dock, that was hit, was canted due to the impact at the joint, where the main dock and the finger meet, and the metal joints in between had a slight bend. The unoccupied pontoon had an indention in the rear starboard side toon, parallel with the motor mount, where the impact moved the finger of the dock and hit his vessel.",2017-00012069,NA,NA,NA

Communications advised me that ems and deputies were on their way to the corner landing where the victim had been brought to shore.  The only information they had at the time was, that it was a tubing accident and the victim had a carabiner impaled in his arm.

I spoke to deputy who advised me he was on the scene and gathering information from the persons involved.  He also advised me that the victim was being transported to parkview regional medical center.  Sgt. also advised me that he had spoken to the operator and he did not believe he had been drinking.  I made arrangements to get the information from sgt. later, and went to parkview.

When i arrived at parkview i spoke with the victim.  Victim advised me that he had been on the lake with his two brothers, operator, who was operating the pwc, and occupant who was the spotter.  

Victim described the incident and how the injury occurred.  He stated that they had been tubing for approximately 45 minutes when operator, who was operating the pwc, slowed down and created some slack in the rope.  When this happened victim went forward and somehow got his arm entangled in the rope.  The rope was attached to the tube by a metal carabiner.  When the pwc again picked up speed the rope and carabiner cinched into victim's arm.  He yelled for help and for them to stop, which they eventually did.  When the rope cinched around victim's lower left arm, the carabiner impaled itself and had to be removed from an unidentified person in a pontoon boat who stopped to provide him aid.  Victim was transported by the pontoon boat to the corner landing where he was met by paramedics.

When the orthopedic nurse came in to examine victim's wound i saw that he had a severe laceration to his lower left arm below the elbow.  There was fat as well as muscle tissue exposed and they began to prep him for surgery.  I took photos of the injury which are included with this report.

I then spoke with operator and occupant who had come into the room.  Both of them described the events just as victim had recounted.  I asked operator if he had consumed any alcohol and he advised me that he had not.  I did not observe anything that indicated that he was under the influence, and i did not smell any alcohol coming from his person.

I Responded. When I arrived I spoke with Park Ranger and he told me that the two injured people had been transported by ambulance to Salina regional Hospital. 

I spoke with an owner of the vessel. She was in the process of removing the vessel from the water. I called GW and he went to Salina Regional Hospital and Interviewed two people. They received 1st and second degree burns on the sides of their bodies. I then spoke with GW and he responded to assist me with inspecting the vessel.

 While waiting for GW I interviewed the owner and operator of the vessel. Operator told me that he unloaded the vessel at Lucas Point boat ramp and immediately drove to the marina to get fuel. He then told me that he had to wait in line at the marina so he parked in a slip. When it was his time he started his vessel and pulled next to the fuel dock with the starboard side of the vessel tied to the fuel dock. 

Operator then told me that after fueling was complete he loaded the passengers which were Occupant1 who was seated on the port side in front of the console, Operator who was seated in the seat located in the bow of the vessel, Occupant2 who was seated on the Starboard side of the vessel in front of the drivers'' console, Occupant3 who was in the captains'' chair on the starboard side. Occupant4 who was seat on the starboard side behind the drivers'' seat, Occupant5 who was seated on the starboard side in the farthest seat near the back of the vessel back onto the vessel, Occupant6 was seated on the port side of the vessel in the furthest rear seat and Occupant7 who was seated on the Port side of the vessel behind the console. Occupant3 turned his ventilation on for approximately 3-5 seconds and then started the vessel and heard a loud pop which he said could have been the vessel back firing. At this time the vessel (Fuel Vapors) Ignited in the rear of the vessel. All occupants of the vessel except for Occupant3 voluntarily exited the vessel. Operator got the fire extinguisher from the Marina fuel dock and used it. The vessel was also untied from the dock at this time and pushed away from the dock. After getting the fire out Operator sad he pulled the exhaust off (Backfire flame arrestor).
 
At approximately 2140 GW arrived and we visually inspected the vessel. We found that the backfire flame arrestor was off of the vessel. It did however appear to have been on the vessel at the time of the fire, due to the amount of fire extinguisher dust on the cap. There was also an absence of fire extinguisher dust inside where the backfire flame arrestor covered. No other serious damage was done to the vessel. GW and I also took pictures and the cleared the scene.",20170461-022,NA,NA,NA

Preliminary indications were that the couple had been possibly exposed to Carbon Monoxide of a toxic level. 
	I also learned that Fire Department officials the night before had taken air readings from inside the boat that far exceeded the toxicity threshold. It was described to me that the boat had to be ventilated for approximately 30 minutes before the air reached a safe level for first responders and coroner's office personnel to enter the boat. 
	He indicated that both of the deceased were found nude, nearly on top of each other, on the floor near the foot of the bed.  No engines were reported as running when they were discovered.
	During an exterior inspection, I observed that the Line 1 shore power supply cord was defective (see photographs). The threaded retainer ring was missing from the supply cord at the boat receptacle. With the ring missing, the plug could easily be disengaged but still appear to be plugged in.  Owner said that he had already purchased another supply cord this year, but had not yet replaced it because the boating season was coming to a close. 
	Owner showed us the one and only Carbon Monoxide detector on the boat. It was located in the berthing area on a wall outside of the bedroom door. He told us that it was hardwired into the boat's power supply system and to his belief, was fully functional. He stated that he knew this because he personally had installed it and had also manufactured the mounting plate that it was affixed to. With the line 1 shore power supply cord fully engaged, a green light was illuminated on the CO detector. 
	Owner allowed us to conduct trials with the boat's shore power system.  We discovered that when the line 1 shore power cord was unplugged completely and also slightly disengaged, the air conditioner unit would not function.  He indicated that Victim1 would not know to check this shore power supply cord to see that it was plugged in completely.
	Additionally, when the line 1 shore power supply cord was disengaged, the green light on the CO detector would turn off possibly indicating that it was not functional.
	Owner further stated that when the boat is secured in his slip, he cannot let the inboard engines idle for very long without Carbon Monoxide building up inside of the cabin. He stated that he normally closes the door to the berthing area to prevent the CO detector from tripping into alarm mode. Owner theorized aloud that Victim1 may have run the inboard engines while in the slip for awhile and then turned them off, causing a CO buildup inside of the boat. 
	Owner indicated that the boat's generator was operational.  Upon request, he started the generator.  The gasoline generator's engine seemed to run and function well. The exhaust port for the generator was located on the starboard hull, forward of the stern and above the water line.
	Before leaving, I told Owner that I thought it would be appropriate for him to contact his boat insurance company and advise of the deaths that had occurred on his boat. He dialed a phone number and appeared to leave a message for someone. 

	After discussing with Det., learning from Owner, inspecting the boat and its equipment, it was my belief that if Carbon Monoxide poisoning was in fact the cause of death for the two individuals, I believe that the Carbon Monoxide could likely be sourced to one of the three gasoline engines on the boat. I also believe that due to the outside temperature in the Portage area on Friday, September 15th, (High 87, Mean 73, low 60 degrees Fahrenheit), anyone spending any significant amount of time in the berthing area would likely be extremely uncomfortable without functional air conditioning. It is possible that at some point, one or more engines were started and ran in attempt to get the air conditioner to function.
Wednesday, September 20, 2017
	On this date, I received a phone call from ICO Brock.  He advised me that he had learned on this date that Owner's boat had been taken to Doyne's Marine for winterization services.  A Doyne's representative indicated that he had discovered the presence of a significant leak in the generator's exhaust manifold. 
Thursday, September 21, 2017
	After learning from ICO of the exhaust manifold leak on the generator, I began to conduct some online research on fuel combustion engines and air/fuel mixture. See attached documents.
	I discovered that when the air supply to engine becomes overly rich in Carbon Monoxide and lacks Oxygen, the engine will ""choke"" and stop running. 
It is possible that:
 - If the line 1 shore power supply cord was not engaged completely the air conditioner would not function
 - The generator was started and had been running inside the engine compartment

I arrived approximately twenty minutes later. I observed one person still in the water with the swamped vessel. A good ""SAM"" was using his boat in a stern tow to pull the swamped vessel in an attempt to remove the water from inside the vessel. I observed the vessel undertow before it sank again. The good ""SAM"" managed to get the boat up and planned off. He towed the vessel to Shoreline boat ramp where a truck and trailer were waiting. When the momentum of the towing vessel slowed down the swamped vessel quickly filled up again and sank behind the trailer at the boat ramp for a third time.

With the vessel crew and assistance from others at the ramp, they loaded the vessel on the trailer and pulled it from the water. While on the trailer I observed an eighteen inch long by one inch wide crack in one of the port lifting strakes forward of the middle of the vessel. Water was pouring back out of the compromised hull.

The operator of the vessel stated that he noticed some water on the deck after they stopped at a restaurant and were out of the vessel. Before loading back in the vessel he used the electric bilge pump to remove the water. Then the group of four spent a half hour tubing behind the vessel at Quietwater Beach before heading home. 

With four persons onboard they were making way in the Intracoastal waterway near the Bob Sikes Bridge headed in a westerly direction. He stated that the motor started sputtering and he noticed more water on the deck. He tried to pump it out with the bilge pump but the electric bilge pump quit working. 

With more water in the hull and the stability of the vessel decreasing, he ran the boat toward shore until it ran aground in water less than three feet deep. Everyone got out the vessel without injury and dragged the vessel as far as they could toward the beach. 

Two good ""SAM'S"" from shore assisted everyone in an attempt the get the water out when FWC arrived on scene. 

Sims stated that the vessel was not his but belonged to his brother.  He stated that they bought the boat without the engine for 300.00 and repaired several areas of the hull. The patch work was apparent (see photo).  The compromised area was an area that had been previously repaired.

	I interviewed the operator of the vessel once we were back at Manatee Cove Marina.  He explained to me that the vessel started taking on water and the bilge pump could not keep up with the volume of water that was coming in.  The vessel was taking on water because the seal around the inboard drive shaft failed and had separated from the wood hull.  He turned the vessel toward shallow water and ran it as shallow as it would go so that the whole vessel would not be submerged.  He had already made contact with Tow Boat U.S. and had them on the way to recover the vessel.  He told me that he would probably have to scrap the vessel because of all of the saltwater damage.

He attempted several times to get his vessel into the slip but continued to have problems.  On one attempt, his vessel hit the fixed dock at the marina and turned sideways on the dock.  At another attempt to get the vessel into the slip, he again got sideways on the dock and while trying to avoid further damage to his vessel or the dock, he throttled his vessel up making a turn to the starboard side and striking his port quarter against the motor of a vessel that was tied to the floating dock in another slip.

	After witnessing this accident, we tied our patrol boat up at the marina and offered assistance to Operator.  I surveyed the damage to both vessels.  Operator's vessel had a large scratch down the port side that appeared to be well through the gel coat.  The vessel also had a crack that was through the fiberglass on the port quarter which would have correlated with when he struck the motor of the other vessel.  The crack was approximately 12 inches in length.  The width was approximately 1.5 inches and was splintered from the puncture.  The damage to the Sportsman vessel appeared to be a bent skeg on the Yamaha VMax 250 of which the tip of the skeg was broken off.  I was able to make contact with Hampton Point Marina staff and identify who the owner of the Sportsman vessel was.  The owner of the Sportsman vessel came to the marina to check on his vessel.  While doing so, I gathered his vessel information for the report.  Both men exchanged information on scene and I gathered all information for reporting purposes.

One of the occupants jumped from V1 while the vessel was in motion. The occupant disappeared under water and did not resurface. The occupant was found the following day, deceased, floating on the surface of Lake Gibson. 

Based on witness statements, Victim sunglasses fell to the deck of V1 and then blew out of V1 and into the water. Victim moved to the back of V1 and then jumped into the water in an attempt to retrieve his sunglasses. 

Operator turned V1 around and approached the location where Victim was swimming in the water. Operator threw a type 1V flotation device to Victim however he was unable to reach it. Operator then jumped into the water and attempted to help Victim swim back to V1 but was unable to do so. Victim disappeared underneath the surface of the water shortly later. 


The cause of death was freshwater drowning, with a contributing cause of death as acute ethanol intoxication. Post-mortem toxicologic analysis demonstrated ethanol in victim blood at an elevated concentration of .338 g/dl and in his bile in an elevated concentration of .392 g/dl.

Upon arrival it was discovered that a vessel had become lodged on top of a submerged stump south of the State Docks on Lake Seminole. We made contact with the operator and occupants of the vessel who were still on scene with the swamped vessel.

The operator stated the throttle cable broke on the vessel while he was travelling north towards the Boat Basin. He indicated that the vessel drifted and became lodged on top of a stump. He advised that he attempted to use the trolling motor to get the vessel off of the stump, but it would not do anything but turn in circles. He indicated that other vessels were passing by causing wakes and the stump eventually punctured the bottom of the vessel causing it to sink. Subjectand an 11 year old child were occupants on the vessel. There were no reports of injuries. The adult occupants of the vessel provided written statements of what occurred. Photographs of the damages to the vessel were taken. The vessel was towed to the Bainbridge Marina by Decatur County Fire and Rescue where it was turned back over to the owner.

We proceeded to run emergency code to the location, arriving at Miami Beach Marina at approximately 2057 hours. As we arrived, we noticed Miami Beach Police Department units were already at the location along with various rescue units from Miami Beach Fire Department. As we docked our patrol vessel in front of the vessel involved in the boating accident, we were advised by Miami Beach Police Department unit that there was only one vessel involved in the incident and that the vessel struck the north jetty of Government Cut. 

Two of the three victims involved in the accident would be transported to the hospital, the other victim received minor treatment for minor lacerations sustained in the event but would accompany the operator to the Ryder Trauma Center. The female victim was transported to Mount Sinai Medical Center. The Miami Beach Police Department alarm number is 17-50554 and the Miami Beach Fire Department alarm number is 17-8066.

After the victims were transported to the hospital(s), Officer and Investigator interviewed and took statements from Victim2 and Victim3, respectively. Both statements confirmed that Victim1 was operating the vessel (he is a hired captain by the owner of the vessel who was in Turkey at the time of the incident). Officer and myself documented and photographed the vessel which was tied up at Miami Beach Marina. The vessel sustained damage under the hull which was photographed while the vessel was still in the water. After the vessel was photographed, the vessel was salvaged by Towboat US to prevent further damage to the vessel and the dock it was tied to due to the damage being below the waterline. It was subsequently taken to the Towboat US Miami River compound.

On April 25, 2016, I spoke to the operator, Victim1 over the phone because he called our dispatch center for information about where the vessel was stored and he spontaneously stated that he was the captain, operating the vessel at the time and impacted the north jetty at Government Cut a few minutes prior to the call being dispatched and he also requested to come and take custody of the vessel. I advised him that the vessel was salvaged to prevent possible further damage to the vessel itself and the dock as a precautionary measure and was not in the custody of the FWC so he could come to the Towboat US compound where they would advise him of the procedures necessary for them to release the boat to him. I also advised him that we would meet and he would have the option of providing a statement if he wanted and he advised me that he wanted to provide a statement to “do the right thing”. He was very eager to provide me with further details regarding the event and I told him to get rest and that we would arrange a time and place so that he could provide a sworn statement if he still wanted to.

On May 9, 2017, I met with Victim1 at the FWC Miami Regional Office. I again reiterated that the statement was completely voluntary and he insisted in providing a statement. I verbally provided Victim1 with his Miranda Rights and also had him read and sign the Miranda warning (Miranda Rights) sworn written statement and he consented to speaking to me and providing a sworn written statement with Miranda Rights advised. 

As, I spoke to him, he advised me that after they proceeded east out of the Bakers Haulover Inlet, they turned south and made their way along the beach staying beyond the swim zone buoy

At approximately 01:30 pm, two witnesses said they were fishing and observed a man, fishing alone in a 19 foot pontoon boat that was tied off to a powerline pylon.  

The two men continued to their fishing location adjacent to victim to check the jugs they previously put out.  Sometime later, they said they heard what sounded like someone shout.  They looked around but did not see anyone and continued to fish.  Approximately 30 minutes later they moved from their fishing location and observed victim's vessel that had been tied up to the powerline pylon now adrift in the lake with no person visibly on board.  They pulled alongside the vessel and saw that no one was on board.  They stated that the outboard motor was running and the throttle was in neutral.  They dropped an anchor to hold the boat there and contacted authorities.  

Nc wildlife law enforcement officers along with holly springs and apex fire departments, wake sherriff deputies, chatham sheriff deputies, a sert team, and shp all responded to the scene.  We had two marked wildlife enforcement boats with officers searching the surface, the shoreline, and providing scene perimeter security.  Wake so and chatham so also provided one boat each.  The fire departments had search boats in the area and with the sert team used sonar to search under water.  I boarded victim's vessel and took photos and video of the inside of the vessel.  No identification was located.  

There were fishing rods, a bucket of fish (crappies), and a bucket of minnows present.  The boat, a 2005 godfrey hurricane deck boat.  A call was made to victim's residence and his wife confirmed that the vessel belonged to him and that he often fished harris lake.  She arrived at the boat ramp a short time later.  Officers met with her at the ramp and explained what was going on.  

They found out from a co-worker that he had called in to be off from work and had gone fishing instead.  The perimeter on the water was maintained and further sonar search continued and the search was called off at 22:00 with a plan to begin again the next morning at 08:00.  We resumed the search the following morning and divers recovered victim around 12:00 that day. 
 
There was no pfd found on victim.  There were seven pfds on the vessel.  At this point, we are unsure of how or why victim ended up in the water.  From the information gathered, it appears his vessel was tied up to a pylon and he was fishing alone.  A firefighter had removed part of a rope from the powerline pylon out on the water before i arrived to the scene.  We noted that that piece of rope matched the rope that was also tied to the bow and stern of the deck boat. The rope was severed.  

At some point, he went overboard and his vessel was found by witnesses drifting east about 600 yards from the pylon. Since his vessel was found running with it in neutral, it is possible that victim cranked his vessel to leave the spot and when he went to untie, the rope broke and he fell overboard.  With moderate wind and choppy water, it is possible that the vessel started drifting and victim tried to swim back to the vessel, which would explain why he was found approximately 21 feet away from the anchored location. 

Additionally his wife stated that her husband had recently been seen by a doctor for muscle cramping issues involving his upper body. Victim's body was located approximately 15 feet from the shoreline and 21 feet beyond the pylon where his vessel had been tied.  

No charges were filed and exact cause of death is still to be determined. No alcohol appears to be involved.  The required safety gear was onboard but unfortunately not being used..

Operator stated that he has been sailing since he was 14 years old.  He said in his experience, when a boat pitch poles, as the vessel did, the mast digs into the mud and can possibly be bent.  Operator also mentioned that electronic components and gear that were onboard, were either missing or not working.  Operator estimated the damage of the vessel somewhere between 10,000 to 15,000 dollars

I did not see any damage to the other boat so I did not call anyone. Prior to the accident a bird struck my windshield earlier in the day causing my windshield to crack.

   Witness#1 stated to the effect: Operator1 was trying to dock his boat and he drifted into the docked boat and cracked his windshield. Operator1 then attempted to remove all of his boats windshield glass from the bow of the docked boat. Operator1 then docked his boat and left the scene.

Investigation reveals: Operator #1 was attempting to dock his vessel on dock #1 at Hawk Island Marina located on the Rancocas Creek in Delanco Twp., Burlington County. As Operator #1 was attempting to dock the boat he lost control of the vessel due to an outgoing tide.  Vessel #1 subsequently drifted in a westerly direction and struck Vessel #2, which was unoccupied and docked at dock #1. Vessel #1 starboard midship struck the port side bow of vessel #2. As a result of the collision vessel #1 sustained a cracked windshield on the starboard side and vessel #2 sustained a cracked window shroud and scratches to the hull on the port bow. No injuries were reported.

Subject2 owns the canoe and they took it without her permission. 

The two men then decided to paddle across Lake Fairview but since there were no paddles, they used a broom and fence spindle. They had no personal flotation devices and the canoe had no navigation lights. During their trip across the lake, the canoe capsized and both men fell into the water. They began swimming for the eastern shore of the lake and yelling for help. At 1:46 A.M., a citizen heard the cries for help and called 911. Orange County Sheriffs Office units and the Orange County Fire Department responded. Several deputies arrived at 1:50 A.M. and the Sheriffs Office helicopter arrived on scene 4 minutes later. 

Master Deputy (Pilot) and Deputy (Tactical Flight Observer) were in the helicopter and located the capsized canoe and Subject1 at 1:58 A.M. Deputy deployed a floatation device from the helicopter and Subject1 initially began swimming towards it but then swam away before reaching it. The Orange County Fire Department had responded with a boat and under the direction of Deputy was able to rescue Subject1 at 2:14 A.M. at location 28 35.734'N, 081 24.289'W, the location was marked with a Pelican float. Subject1 told them that Operator was also with him, so the continued for Operator. Orange County Fire Department transported Subject1 to Florida Hospital South where he was examined and released. At 3:43 A.M., Deputy arrived on scene to assist, He launched his vessel and located the capsized canoe at 28 35.686'N, 081 24.337W, the location was marked with a Pelican float. The on scene personnel continued to search for Operator throughout the day and night using a helicopter and boats with sonar equipment. On August 11, 2017 at 2:00 A.M., Deputy located Operator, lifeless. His body was beginning to surface out of 8.8' of water at a location of 28 35.794'N, 081 24.244'W. Personnel recovered Operator's body from the lake and the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office to custody of him. The Medical Examiner determined the cause of death to be accidental drowning. 

I interviewed Subject1 after he was released from the hospital and he provided additional details about the events. He said that he and Operator had both been drinking for several hours that evening. When they left in the canoe, he sat in the back paddling with a spindle and Operator was in the front paddling with a broom. Operator began fooling around ""shaking"" the canoe and Subject1 told him to stop, which he did. A short time later, when they were about halfway across the lake, Operator stood up and shook the canoe causing it to capsize. They both fell into the water but not injured. Operator told Subject1 to hold onto the canoe. Subject1 grabbed one end and Operator the other. Subject1 said he did not feel safe because he thought the canoe was going to sink, so he swam away and started yelling for help. He told Operator to swim away too and saw him begin to swim with him using an overhand stroke. That was the last time Subject1 saw Operator and at that time Operator was off to the right hand side of him. He said the next thing he remembers is the rescue. 

The Medical Examiner's report, to include the toxicology results, is not completed at the time of this submission.

I spoke with a dispatcher on the phone, and was told that the injured party was  going to be transported to Resolute Hospital in New Braunfels, Texas, for a possible knee injury. 

At this time, I asked the dispatcher if there was any type of collision between the vessel (TX: 2658 BM) and another vessel, or a fixed object. I was told that the vessel did not collide with another boat, but that subject had injured her left knee while wake-boarding. I asked the dispatcher to have a deputy on scene to collect the TX numbers from the vessel and the names of the other passengers on board because I was 45 minutes from the lake. I told dispatch that I would make contact with Victim at Resolute Hospital because she was already en route via ambulance from Canyon Lake. 

I arrived at Resolute Hospital at around 2:00 p.m., and made contact with Victim in the emergency room, and asked her if I could ask her some questions about the accident. Victim stated that he was being towed by her father and that her mother was a passenger on the boat. Victim was wake-boarding near the mouth of Turkey Cove (Boat Ramp 2) when she hit a wake with the front of her wake board which caused her to twist her left knee awkwardly, and dislocate her patella. Victim stated that she was wearing a life jacket at the time of the accident, and that she had not drank any alcohol that day. Victim stated that she has had knee issues in the past and that she believed it to be a result of her past knee injuries. 

Victim stated that her parents had not drank any alcohol that day, and would be coming to the hospital shortly to be with her. I left my card for Victim, and asked her to call if she had any questions.

As I was leaving, I made contact with parents and talked to them briefly in the hospital parking lot, where I observed no signs of intoxication. 

From my investigation, I determined that there was no negligence on the part of operator, and it was merely an accident that Victim wake-board caught a wake which caused her to injure her knee.

Operator explained that he lost an engine and got caught up in the current causing him to travel sideways and slam into the fender system with his Port Side Rear. Operator advised that he was not taking on water but did sustain heavy fiberglass damage. Operator stated that no was injured as a result of the incident. I inspected the damage to Operator's vessel and observed substantial fiberglass damage to the port side rear which would be consistent with hitting the bridge's fender system.

Sea Tow was in process of towing it to shallows at S.end of Pea Patch, grounding it so a patch could be placed over where the outdrive was ripped from then floating it to Del City Marina to pull.

  Distances -  N. tip of Pea Patch Island to ""WPPA"" ( Jetty Marker Sign ) 693 yds.  ""WPPA"" TO ""WPPC"" 652 yds.  ""WPPC"" to POI 250 yds. POI to Buoy ""17"" 944 yds.  These distances are approx using Google Earth Tool.

  Writer was able to inspect vessel PA1224DG at the the Delaware City Marina where it was in the travel lift being placed on jack stands.  Writer observed minor scratches on the keel, the outdrive took the main impact and had all the bolts sheared and out drive was missing. The swim platform did show some cracking but that was believed to be from post collision probably while capsized laying on bottom.

Upon arriving to the scene I spoke with subject who informed me that he was not the owner but that his son who owned the vessel was out of the state in Florida. Subject1 introduced to his grandson, who was at the residence when the fire happened.  Subject1’s grandson reported that he was inside the house and had no idea that the vessel was on fire and was not certain on how the fire would have even started.  
          
      It was at this time that Subject1 introduced me to the person who first witnessed the fire and alerted Solomons Volunteer Fire and Rescue.  He reported that he was driving when he noticed the vessel docked to the pier on fire.  Witness1 said that he called fire and rescue and proceeded to make Subject1’s grandson aware of the fire.  Witness1 also went onto the dock where the fire was happening to try and clear Subject1's kayaks and other boats out of the path of the fire. 

      The vessel that was destroyed was a 43 foot, fiberglass, cabin motorboat with duel diesel inboard engines.  It was a Tiara vessel that Subject1 had documented with the name ""Mojo Risin.""  The vessel has been completely destroyed by the fire.  The firefighters on scene reported that there were no fluids leaking out of the vessel however and for that reason they did not believe the fire was fuel related.  

      When speaking to the first firefighter on scene he reported that upon arrival the vessel had been tied up to the dock with all dock lines in tact, although the fire had quickly burnt through some on the stern side.  He also reported that the shore power plug was still connected to the vessel and that the AC was running.  He reported that he had to disconnect the plug from the vessel himself.  It is possible that the fire started from an electrical issue but due to the fact that no one was present when the fire actually started no one was able to absolutely say why it would have started.  

      Subject1 was currently on his way home from Florida when all events occurred, when speaking to me over the phone he had yet to make plans on salvaging the vessel. 

      On August 3, 2017 I spoke with Fire Marshal in regards to his investigation on this case.  He reported that the vessel had two air conditioning units running at the time of the fire.  Marshal was able to determine that the front unit of the two which was set to dehumidify started the fire. 
      
      Subject1 owns two additional boats that sustained damage from the fire.  One being a 1973 13 foot Boston Whaler registered through Maryland as 9826CH, the other being a 2007 23 foot Century registered through Maryland as 6356CA.  Subject1 reports that there has been some blistering to the sides of the boats as a result from the heat of the fire.

The collision occurred in a portion of Toledo Bend Lake, known as Pirates Cove.  When I arrived on scene I found both vessels had returned to shore and was stationary at the Pirates Cove marina boat launch.  I then made contact with the occupants of both vessels.  

Vessel 1 (LA 4336 FE) was operated with no passengers on board.  Vessel 2 (LA-8960FD) had one passenger on board. All occupants were asked if they needed medical attention, with all refusing medical treatment. 

 Operator1 stated that he received a scratch on his upper right chest, as well on top of his right hand (see attached photo log).  

Operator2 stated that his left hand around his ring finger was very sore to the touch and swollen (see attached photo log).  V2 occupant1 stated that she had previously broke her right leg and it was in a cast but during the collision she was thrown to the floor of the vessel landing on an anchor with her right leg.  She noticed it swelling and that she had a small irritated area around her knee determined to be from the carpet in the bottom of the vessel (see attached photo log).  

At this time LT. arrived on scene and we once again spoke to all about medical attention with all refusing any treatment.  Both operators were determined not to be impaired.  A boating safety check of both vessels revealed no violations of boating safety equipment.  Both parties agreed to return to their camps and on the next day attempt to retrieve vessels from the water.  

On February 25, 2017, Lt., Agent and I was able to meet with both operators and the passenger at Pirates Cove Marina to continue our investigation into the crash.  After interviewing all occupants (see attached statement forms), it was determined that V1 was traveling east in an unmarked boat lane returning from an island located west of Pirates Cove.  V2 was traveling south in a boat lane marked by buoys from an area north of Pirates Cove known as Toro Bay.  The direction that both vessels were traveling put V2 starboard side to V1 bow.  V1 was traveling straight into Pirates Cove Marina as V2 was traveling across Pirates Cove Marina towards an area known as Army Recreational.  

As V2 operator realized that a collision was going to occur, he came off throttle in attempt to slow his vessel enough to avoid a collision.  The operator seated at the helm located on the starboard side, and the passenger seated in the seat at the stern of V2 determined that the operator of V1 had not seen them so they began screaming and waving their arms in attempt to get the attention of the operator of V1, moments before the collision occurred.  

They both stated that the operator was looking south while traveling east and never made visual contact with them until the collision occurred.  Operator of V1 stated that he was traveling approximately 25 M.P.H. to 30 M.P.H. because he had purchased a new motor for his vessel and was operating it within the guidelines from the manufacturer break in period.  He was returning to Pirates Cove Marina where he had launched from and did not see V2 until the collision occurred.  

V1 bow struck V2 on the starboard side before the bow, causing severe damage to both vessels. Measurements from V2 showed that at the impact it had damage approximately 10ft. wide and 5ft. inward (see attached photo log).  V1 received severe fiberglass damage to the bow and both starboard and port side of the vessel.  Measurements from V1 Showed the damage beginning at the bow and traveling approximately 5 ft. along both starboard and port sides (see attached photo log).  Damage to V2 was at an estimated cost of $10,000.00, with miscellaneous items damaged or lost at an estimated cost of $3,200.00.  Operator2 listed items: sunglasses $150.00, eyeglasses $300.00, 3 rod and reels $300.00, igloo cooler $80.00, igloo cooler $150.00, and one ROSCOE medical scooter (rental).  Damage to V1 was at an estimated cost of $8,000.00, miscellaneous items damaged or lost at an estimated cost of $1,500.00.  Operator1 listed items: minnkota four track trolling motor $1,300.00 and Lowrance 125 depth finder $200.00.  

After completing the investigation Operator1 was issued citation for R.S. 34:851.4 careless operation of a watercraft.  Operator1 was explained his court date and after signing his citation was released.  Agents later learned from v2 occupant that on February 26, 2017, Operator2 received medical treatment from an emergency room visit at Lake Area Medical Center where he learned he had received a fracture in his ring finger on his left hand from the crash.  They occupant1 both continued medical treatment from Center of Chiropractic and Rehabilitation Center for soreness and stiffness resulting from the crash.

The vessel involved in the accident was a 26’ white well craft cabin boat displaying Florida registration FL2313HW.

I interviewed and received a sworn written statement from the owner he stated that the accident occurred around 1230 pm. He explained to me that, as the boat was coming off the trailer he noticed that the vessel started taking on water and took vessel back out of the water. He requested assistance from two individual to stop the water from coming into the boat. The boaters said to him it was normal and that the bilge pumps would take the water out.

After putting the boat in to the water the boat immediately started taking on water and sunk within a minute in approximately 5 feet of water.

He had been doing work to him vessel and is currently unaware on how much damage it has caused to the vessel.

V1 was unable to stop for assistance from Law Enforcement due to the flow of boats from the floatilla ""invasion"". Operator1 was able to get a phone number from V2 and were able to communicate to discuss the accident. Another vessel was tied to V2. Vessel V3 was said to have possibly hit V1 also. 

After V1 docked next to the Convention Center,  Operator1 called FWC to report the accident. At approximately 1418hrs I received the call from dispatch to meet with V1. After arriving on scene Ofc. began speaking to Operator1 about the accident. She was able to obtain vessel registration numbers from the other two boats and a description of what happened. Operator1 stated that during the flotilla he was sitting stationary in Seddon Channel facing north when two boats that were at anchor hit his vessel. V2, facing west, had an engine running when an occupant slipped and tried to catch herself but instead hit the throttle which caused V2 & V3 to lunge forward striking the starboard side of V1 at a 90 degree angle approximately. i was never able to make contact with occupant after numerous attempts.

Extensive damage was noticed inside and outside of V1 from the impact from V2 . Occupants on V1 stated that V3 struck V1 in the aft starboard corner and caused a chunk of fiberglass to break off. Photographs were taken of the damage to V1 (see attached statement for photos). 

Throughout the day we could not locate V2 or V3. After calling the phone number that was given by V2 we were able to make contact with the owner of V2. He said that he waited around for about 30 minutes for Law Enforcement to arrive and decided to head back to the ramp. I was able to meet with him on Sunday to speak to him about the accident. Operator2 stated that an occupant in his vessel slipped and hit the throttle which caused his vessel to strike V1. He wrote out a sworn written statement describing the accident. Operator2's vessel did not obtain any damage from the accident. Operator2 spoke to the operator of V3 and gave him my State cell number and asked that he called me. 

As I was on my way to V3 registered address he called me. V3 subject stated what happened and said that he did not think his vessel struck V1 during the incident. I continued to drive to his address to look for any damage to his vessel. As I arrived the vessel was on a lift at his parents address. I got on the vessel to look for any damage and was not able to find any. I felt around the rub rail and underneath and down the bow of the vessel and did not detect any damage to V3. Thru my investigation it did not appear that V3 struck V1 due to no damage being on V3. It could be possible that V3 struck V1 and does not show damage to V3, but there is no way to confirm this from the physical evidence.

Both V1 and V2 have insurance thru Geico Marine. Both insurance companies were notified. 

CONCLUSION:

After my investigation, it is my belief that V1 was indeed sitting stationary when V2 hit it causing extensive damage. Citing United States Coast Guard Navigation Rule 8 (see below), V2 operator Operator2 was responsible for the accident at hand.

33 CFR 83.08 - Action to avoid collision (Rule 8)
(e) If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.

On April 12, 2017 I responded to a boat accident on Watauga Lake in Carter County, Tennessee. I arrived at Rat Branch Boat Ramp approximately 1900. When I arrived on scene, I determined that there were two vessels involved in an accident near the mouth of a cove outside the entrance to Cove Ridge Marina. Both individuals were the single occupant on PWC''s that they were each operating. Both vessels are owned by the mother of operator1. Upon collision of the vessels, both vessels were inoperable and a nearby boater was able to transport both operators and Vessel 1 back to Rat Branch. Vessel 2 was secured to the bank near the scene of the accident and was later retrieved by myself, 4270 and 4221. Upon arriving at Rat Branch, Operator1 was transported by EMS to Johnson City Medical Center for injuries that he received from the accident. Operator1 had visible lacerations and bruising to his left leg. He was evaluated and released later that night from the hospital. Operator1 received further medical treatment at a later date and was determined to have a torn ACL, PCL, MCL, and meniscus in his left knee and arterial damage resulting in a low pulse in his left leg.

Summary of statements provided by Vessel Operators: 
Both vessels were launched together at Rat Branch Boat Ramp and traveled up stream. Upon approaching the Highway 67 Bridge, both vessels made a left turn and stopped at a nearby point. The area in which the vessels stopped is at the mouth of a cove outside of Cove Ridge Marina. After stopping for less than five minutes, Operator1 departed on Vessel 1 at approximately 5-10mph. Shortly thereafter, Operator2 departed on Vessel 2 traveling in the same direction. Vessel 2 was traveling behind and to the port side of Vessel 1. Both vessels were headed from the cove further upstream when Operator1 decided to change direction and head towards Cove Ridge Marina. Vessel 1 slowed down and started a sharp left turn towards the marina. Operator1 was unaware of the exact location or distance to Vessel 2 at the time.  When Vessel 1 turned, it immediately came into the path of Vessel 2. Operator2 let off the throttle on Vessel 2, but was unable to slow the vessel enough to avoid collision. Vessel 2 continued on its path and then impacted the port side of Vessel 1. On impact, the vessel struck the left leg of Operator1 causing injuries and continued on to the top of Vessel 1. Operator1 was ejected from his vessel on impact. Operator2 was able to stay on his vessel but swam to a nearby boat when his began to flood and sink.

Damage Assessment:
Vessel 1 sustained damage to the steering console and hull near the location of the seat. The console is broken from the vessel and is connected only by the wiring harness. Plastic from the hull is broken away from the vessel. The seat was also dislodged from the vessel and was not recovered. Vessel 2 sustained damage to the bottom front of the hull. There are cracks and a hole approximately 14 inches in diameter in the hull that caused the vessel to flood.",17410561,NA,NA,NA

Operator of the boat allowed Passenger to operate the boat has he attached and secured the boat cover to protect the boat occupants from the elements.  The operator resumed operation of the boat after the boat cover was in place. 

Crash Investigation:

It appears the boat was traveling in a southeast direction, parallel to the shipping channel and north of the Cat Island break wall.  The weather conditions of heavy rain, strong winds, and three to five foot waves, would have reduced visibility.  With the boat cover on and secured, visibility was reduced to the windshield with no installed wipers.  There was no electronic navigation aboard and it is unknown if a cellular phone with GPS was used.  The boat struck the Cat Island break wall approximately 100 yards west of the shipping channel.  The boat struck the break wall with enough speed to allow the boat to ramp up the side of the break wall and come to a rest across the causeway approximately eight to ten feet above the waterline.  Operator and passenger were ejected from the boat.  (Noted – There are no lighted navigational aids or sound warning devices located on the Cat Island break wall.)

On 07/02/2017 at approximately 1115 hours I, US Park Ranger L, was called by dispatch to a hit and run vessel accident at the Bullfrog main ramp. I was informed of the vessel accident by dispatch; however I had heard the radio communications between one of our AIS Rangers and Dispatch for further information. It was stated over the radio that the houseboat (a 1990 RHR Houseboat named Jest-4-Fun) had struck a ski boat (a 2005 Four Winns Horizon 230) and the houseboat was seen leaving the scene of the accident. It was later found out that the houseboat dropped off a party member for information exchange and was moving away from the main ramp to avoid hitting anyone else. The house boat claimed to have had an engine failure just prior to the vessel collision.

INITIAL
On 07/02/2017 at approximately 1115 hours I was dispatched to a vessel accident at the Bullfrog main ramp. No injuries were reported. I arrived on scene at approximately 1120 hours to find the vessel being put on the truck and trailer at the Bullfrog main ramp by the owner. I spoke with OPERATOR1 briefly and told him to move the damaged vessel on its trailer up to the prep lanes above the main ramp. At this time I noticed the back left side of the vessel had sustained a large amount of damage where fiberglass was punctured and indented from being struck by another vessel. I followed OPERATOR1 up the launch ramp and regained contact to begin the vessel accident report. While I was taking the vessel accident report from OPERATOR1, US Park Ranger boated over from Halls Crossing to assist in the vessel accident. Ranger met with houseboat Jest-4-Fun,at the Bullfrog fuel dock to gather vessel information and take pictures of any damage.

INVESTIGATION
I spoke with OPERATOR1 and asked him to explain to me what exactly happened. OPERATOR1 said that the houseboat Jest-4-Fun was coming into the courtesy dock at the Bullfrog main ramp where OPERATOR1 had just put his boat in the water. 

OPERATOR1 continued by saying the houseboat came into the courtesy dock and wasn't able to stop short of hitting his boat. The houseboat has a metal push bumper extended around the bow of the boat which is what made contact with OPERATOR1's ski boat. OPERATOR1 stated that the houseboat immediately backed out and began leaving the Bullfrog main ramp. As he and his family thought the houseboat was leaving the scene, they gathered information from other bystanders for witness statements and gathered as much vessel descriptors for the houseboat as they could. Once I got a clear understanding of what happened according to OPERATOR1, I collected all needed information for the vessel accident report, and took pictures of all the damage to vessel. I gave OPERATOR1 my business card with information pertaining to the vessel accident and how to obtain a copy of it for insurance purposes. Before clearing the main ramp I spoke with another gentleman that was part of the houseboat Jest-4-Fun's party. The male stayed behind in good faith to exchange information if needed and to let everyone know that the houseboat and operator were not leaving the scene to run, but to clear out so they would not hit any other vessels due to engine failure. I cleared the main ramp at approximately 1210 hours.

At approximately 1215 hours I arrived at the Bullfrog fuel dock to follow up with Ranger and the operator of vessel Jest-4-Fun. Ramger had obtained all needed information, pictures, and a vessel safety inspection prior to my arrival. I continue over to the houseboat operator. I spoke with operator2 about how our process works for vessel accidents and gave him my business card with information for the vessel accident and how to obtain a copy of it for insurance purposes. operator2 inquired about any injuries for the other party in which I informed him there were none. I cleared the BF fuel docks and the vessel accident at approximately 1230 hours.

According to a written statement from Passenger (attached), they were at anchor and noticed the boat was taking on water.  They pulled up the anchor and headed towards the shore. The boat continued to swamp with water causing the bow to nosedive into the water. Operator and Passenger were then ejected from the boat into the water.  

Passenger and Operator swam towards the dock when Passenger heard Operator yelling for help. Passenger swam back towards Operator and witnessed Operator bob up and down in the water. Passenger yelled to Operator to swim and hold onto the buoy but Operator was unable to, this was the last time Passenger saw Operator.

Passenger held onto the buoy for approximately 20 minutes but could not locate Operator. Passenger removed his clothing and swam back to the boat dock. Passenger walked down the road and got help from a random driver. Passenger called 911 and was transported to the hospital and admitted for hypothermia. 

On 10/21/17, Operator'' body was found at approximately 4:45 PM by the Sangamon County Search and Rescue team.  The Christian County Coroner''s office took possession of the body and a toxicology report was completed on10/30/17.  The coroner''s report indicated the death was due to drowning. 

On Nov 30, 2017 at approximately 12:30 PM, I towed the boat and trailer involved in the accident to the east boat launch at Sangchris State Park. I ensured the plug was installed correctly and tied the boat to the trailer. I launched it approximately 20 feet from the dock. I got onboard and after approximately three minutes, the bottom of the boat showed water flowing in. I checked the plug and noticed some water near the plug, but no movement of water coming in from the plug. The water seemed to be coming from under the carpeted area near the stern. After approximately 20 minutes from initial launch; the boat had approximately 4 inches of water inside. 

I recovered the boat moved it and the trailer onto a level surface. I began to look underneath the boat and found an X-shaped crack where the hull of the boat rides on a caster when it is trailered. The trailer had four casters installed upside down on the trailer in order to make recovery of the boat easier. The hull had dull colored spots where the boat rested on the casters. 

The investigation revealed that the polymer casters used in construction of the homebuilt trailer contributed to the boat swamping with water. The hull of the boat is aluminum and the casters used were polymer, a much harder material than aluminum. Anytime the boat was transported on the homebuilt trailer, the hull bounced onto the caster repetitively. These small impacts caused a weakening of the hull and a crack developed. Water entered the vessel through the crack and eventually swamped the boat.

There was no capacity plate inside the boat. I calculated the capacity of the boat using the formula determined by the National Marine Manufacturers Association; (Number of people = vessel length (ft.) x vessel width (ft.) ÷ 15). The capacity of the Polarcraft boat was 600 lbs. Factoring in the weight of the occupants (Operator = 213 lbs, Passenger = 175 lbs) and the weight of the equipment (approximately 100 lbs), the boat was not overloaded.

Subject1 recognized that one of the males was struggling and in peril and the other male (Operator) was closer to the shore.  Subject1 then paddled the canoe and to give a life jacket to Operator who was closer to the beach and told him to swim to shore.  As Subject1 approached Occupant, he kept his distance knowing occupant was panicking.  He then threw him a life jacket and was able to calm occupant down.  Subject1 instructed him to hold onto the canoe as he paddled to shore towing Occupant along the side of the canoe.  EMS arrived on scene to assist both victims.  EMS transported Operator to RI Hospital for high blood pressure and chest pains.  From the investigation, Off. learned that Subject1 was a former Boy Scot trained as a canoe instructor and also a former life guard.  Subject1's training and decisive actions lead to a successful rescue that saved the life of two men.

V01 WEIGHT LOAD AND SPEED PRODUCED LARGE WAKE
V02 AFFECTED BY WAKE AND PUSHED UNDER V03 CAUSING DAMAGE

V2 subject explained that he and his guests were aboard their larger vessel. the M/V ""Giddyap"" when they heard a vessel (later to be identified as FL 2255NT) transit the area at a high rate of speed and at close proximity to their vessel. V2 subject watched the vessel and witnessed the operator  transit a commercial crawfish vessel with crawfish traps aboard at a high rate of speed.  The two factors of the vessel having increased weight because of the load and the vessels speed caused it to displace a larger wake than normal operation causes. This large wake traversed towards V2 subjects vessel and caused the inflatable dinghy (later to be identified as  FL8475PW ) to be pushed towards and under the larger vessel, the M/V ""Giddyap"".  This action caused damage to the seat bracket of FL 8475 PW and fiberglass damage to the M/V ""Giddyap""

    	Operator1 did not slow his vessel and continued transiting the area. V2 subject boarded FL8475PW and followed Operator1 into Newfound Harbor. After a short while, Operator1 slowed his vessel and came to a stop. V2 subject and Operator1 discussed the boating accident. Neither of the persons exchanged information post accident. (This was documented in a video provided by V2 subject and corroborated by information provided by Operator1)	V2 subject forwarded me the videos and pictures via email. 

	 I made contact with Operator1 the following day and met with him at his residence and commercial dock. Operator1's own witness account was consistent with V2 subjects.  Operator1 advised that because he placed a larger than normal amount of crawfish traps on his vessel, slowing down in the area would have created an unsafe speed and risk the safety of his vessel and crew. Therefore by overloading his vessel, he felt he was mandated to travel at speed while traversing the area. Operator1 advised that normally he does slow his vessel in that area so as not to wake other people, or vessels in the area. 

	Operator1 was issued a non-criminal citation for careless operation of a vessel due to vessel overloading and excessive speed causing a higher than normal wake in a high traffic area. Negligence was also established as Operator1 new there was a duty of care for other vessels in the area, breached that duty of care by overloading his vessel thus requiring him to operate his vessel at a high speed and that breach caused injury or damage to property.",FWSB17OFF002495,NA,NA,NA

Around 12:00 pm, they then decided to take the visiting friends on a sightseeing boat cruise toward the dam of Hiwassee Lake from Mountain View Marina (Bear Paw Marina).  Upon exiting the cove, which the marina is located, Operator took a left and motored toward the lower end of Hiwassee Lake in hopes of arriving at the lake's dam.  Half way between the marina and the dam, Operator made a left turn around a long and sharp point which was sticking out into the lake.  In speaking with all parties involved, there was an agreement that while making the turn around the point, objects began to blow around in the boat.  Also, the passengers began to walk around the boat in an attempt to collect these objects before they blew out and into the water.  All parties stated that Operator became distracted by the objects blowing around in the boat and was looking down and into the boat while making the turn.  Operator continued to make the left turn while looking at the objects in the boat, which guided the vessel straight into a large rocky outcropping on the shore of the lake. Just before the vessel grounded on the outcropping subject2 looked up and noticed the vessel was about to hit the shore. He then yelled to Operator to look out. Operator tried to turn the vessel away from the shore but the vessel was too close to avoid grounding.

The vessel made impact on the port side striking the shore 1/3 of the way back from its bow.  It was traveling at approximately 20-40 MPH.  The vessel traveled around 10-15 feet up and onto the rocky outcropping from the water level.  Along the way up the outcropping, large chunks of fiberglass were ripped from the port side and under the vessel.  These were left on the rocky shore line as evidence of the crash.  The boat then slid back into the water and was still afloat.  Operator was then able to navigate the vessel at a slow rate of speed back to the marina for help.

During the impact, Subject2 was thrown forward into the floor of the vessel and sustained a broken collar bone.  His wife, Subject3, sustained no visible injuries but complained of soreness in her ribs and shoulders.  

Subject1, who was standing at the time of impact, was thrown forward and sustained injuries of a broken collar bone and a cracked pelvis.  Operator was ejected from the driver seat of the vessel and made contact with the driver side windshield.  He sustained lacerations to his right wrist and leg.  

Subject2 and Subject1 were transported via ambulance to Union General Hospital in Blairsville Georgia.  Operator and Subject3 transported themselves by vehicle to the same facility.  All were admitted into the care of Union General Hospital in Blairsville Georgia.

No other vessels were involved in this boating incident.  The damage to the vessel could be beyond the value of the vessel itself ($25,000).  Also, all four parties on the vessel received medical treatment beyond that of first aid.

I activated my lights and siren and got to the dock were Ranger and launched the patrol boat.  I activated the lights and siren from the dock and got on plain toward the Jumping Rocks where the incident was said to be.  The water was very rough with waves of 3'-4' from peak to trough.  Wind was approx 25mph and from the southwest.

As I neared the Jumping Rocks I saw a lot of people swimming near the rocks but no one in distress.  Then I looked further toward the dam and saw a debris field and a boat bobbing with the boat upside down with maybe 2' out of the water.  As I got closer I saw some people swimming toward the shore which was about  60' from the boat.  I got in close to the shore and had Ranger get off to locate the party.  I told her to get a head count and I backed out away from the rocks.  She was able to locate the owner and all 12 members of the party.  I asked her over the radio if any needed medical.  She said no which was relayed to dispatch.  The boat kept drifting and made its way to a cove where it stayed afloat with bottom up.  Members of the party were gathered and I told Ranger to pick a few people and the owner.  We would boat them back and have Ranger go back with her truck to get the rest.  We loaded operator and two girls and took them to the main dock.  I confirmed no medical needs.

According to OPERATOR, the series of events were:
-wakeboarding near the north dam on the west side
-they brought the wakeboarder in due to increasing waves
-while loading the took a few waves over the top of the boat
-OPERATOR emptied the ballast tanks
-she began to throttle into the waves but the rolling waves crashed into the boat
-she had everyone put on lifejackets
-as boat took on an unrecoverable amount of water she told everyone to get off
-she and one friend stayed on to the point of it going under and then they got off as it listed on its side
-everyone was off at the point the waves rolled the boat onto its top

The county dive team came out and after the storm stopped we went to recover it.  As the boat was rolled onto its side, the bilge button was seen in the on position and it was pumping water.  The boat was fully rolled upright and I towed it to the main dock with the park boat.  It was put on the trailer and slowly pulled out as water was drained.  I called OPERATOR around 2030 hours and we agreed she would pick it up in the morning.  Due to the water still left in the boat I had her sign a liability release before taking it onto the road.

As he zoomed into the mouth of the shipping channel, the bottom of his boat struck a large pipe protruding inches above the water off an underwater break wall. The heavy pipe shredded the fiberglass hull the 21-foot Ranger Boat on impact and ejected both men into the lake.  Both anglers were jettisoned across the front deck, over the bow and into 30 feet of water. One was knocked temporarily unconscious when his face slammed into the console on his way out of the boat. Fortunately for both men, the boat turned sharply away as they were tossed over the nose and neither man was struck by the propeller. The boat came to rest against channel rocks. He had the outboard “kill” switch attached to his life vest but had forgotten to attach it to the throttle connector.  The boat did slow to idle speed when his foot came off the gas. Both anglers were wearing life jackets.  One had a traditional foam-filled jacket that covers the back and chest; one was wearing a harness style vest designed to inflate when submerged, it didn’t. He regained consciousness underwater and surfaced The other man was struggling due to his badly injured legs - the prop on the electric motor cut it when he was thrown over the top of it.

V2 (FL 1804 NN; 11 foot multicolored personal watercraft) occupied by two adult individuals. 

V1 was recreationally cruising north east from Dunlawton Bridge. V1 operator stated she was operating at a slow speed when she was headed towards V2. V1 operator stated she didn’t believe she was getting that close to V2 until it was too late. V1 operator stated she initially had released the throttle to try and stop but upon impact hit the throttle causing V1 to go over V2. (Note: personal watercraft do not have off throttle steering).
 
V2 was sitting idle, facing south. V2 operator and passenger stated neither one thought V1 was an issue to their safety, until V1 directly off their side. V2 operator and passenger crouched down to try and avoid injury. 

The starboard side/ bow of V1 impacted V2 on its starboard bow/side. V1 pushed V2 due to forward momentum for a short distance and then due to V1 operator engaging the throttle went up and over V2. When the collision happened it caused the operator and passenger of V1 to be thrown into the water. V2 operator and passenger were also knocked into the water from impact with V1. 

A witness nearby on a personal watercraft (employee with the rental company; Southside Jet Ski LLC) observed the accident and arrived on scene to pull V2 operator out of the water.

On or about 2:30 a.m. on 15 October 2017, boat operator was operating a 2011 Mastercraft X-Star on Abbotts Creek at High Rock Lake.  

The operator had one passenger.  The operator was leaving Top of the Rock, a bar on High Rock Lake off Shore Dr. in Lexington.  The operator was travelling north on Abbotts Creek which is upstream.  The operator was attempting to return to his residence.  The time was approximately 2:30 a.m. and the weather was cool and very foggy. 

The operator explained that he was travelling using the cruise control at approximately 25 mph when he thought it was appropriate to turn west, rounding the furthest northern point in that section of Abbotts Creek to go under the Holloway Church Rd bridge.  

The operator failed to realize his exact location and was approximately one-half mile from the area he thought he was in.  When the boat was travelling due west, Operator drove the boat aground at approximately 25 mph.  The boat travelled completely out of the water and into several shrubs, trees, and crushed a picnic table.  

During the crash, the operator suffered a laceration across the forehead above the right eye.  The passenger was uninjured due to the fact that she was facing rearward in the vessel sitting in an observation seat generally used to observe a skier.  Operator was transported to the hospital by Davidson County EMS, and Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer arrived at the hospital while EMS was taking Operator inside.  Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer spoke with Operator and formed the opinion that he was impaired.  Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer charged the operator with boating while impaired and consent was given for a blood draw by the operator.  Operator had not received care from the hospital at that point so Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer cited and released.  Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer went to the scene of the crash and took photos of the vessel.  The vessel was removed from the property the same day prior to noon by owner Operator.  Form 4.1 from the operator has not been received as of this date.

I then heard a loud pop followed by an explosion.  When I looked back, the engine compartment hatch flew off the boat into the air and a large burst of flames came up and around the people sitting in the back of the boat (victim # 1 and #2).  When this happened we all jumped out of the boat into the water.  A friend in another boat later showed up and helped us.  The two that were hurt were then taken by the other State Police boat for help.  

  Wittness # 1 Stated to the effect:  I was in the cabin when I heard the explosion.  I grabbed my dog and got out of the cabin.  We all then jumped into the water.  

  Investigation Revealed:     On the listed date and time, Vessel # 1 was leaving Roundabout Creek entering Great Bay, Little Egg Harbor Twp.  As the operator accelerated from the slow speed area the vessel backfired, causing an explosion.  The engine compartment cover blew off the vessel located at the stern of the vessel exposing flames to victim s who were seated at the stern of the vessel.  Passenger # 1 heard the explosion and exited the cabin area with her dog.  All 4 occupants and the dog then jumped into the waterway in approximately 5 feet of water and swam away from the burning vessel.  A friend of the operator arrived shortly after and picked up the occupants.  SFC took the victims to Great Bay Blvd. to meet with medical transport.  	

  Injuries Sustained:    Victim # 1 sustained minor burn injuries to the neck area.  He was taken to Southern Ocean County Hospital, Stafford NJ for evaluation.  He was treated and released.  Victim # 2 sustained 1st and 2nd degree burns to his torso and head area.  He was flown to Temple Burn Unit Philadelphia PA by Penstar 6.  He was treated and released on 7/4/17.  

  Vessel Damage Sustained:    Shortly after the explosion vessel # 1 became fully engulfed with flames.  The vessel continued to burn to the waterline.  The vessel drifted into about 2 feet of water and approximately 50 feet from the marsh line.  LEHT Fire and Rescue extinguished the remains.  The vessel remains are partially submerged and owner will be responsible to remove same from the waterway.

     It should be noted that the operator advised me that he recently purchased the vessel and was doing engine work to same.  He indicated that he bought the boat for $3k dollars and invested $600 into same.  He stated that it was running rough earlier in the day.  It should also be noted that the vessel was not registered by the operator.  He was issued a summons for Failure to Register.  The statements from victims aboard vessel concurred with operator # 1.  No other witnesses were identified at the scene.  Arson Bomb Unit was notified and appraised of this accident.  Crime Scene responded and documented same.

Operator was operation a 20' bay stealth boat in the Inter Coastal Waterway.  Operator was traveling north in the channel and encountered a south tug boat pushing a barge.  Operator slowed her boat and moved out of the channel to the east.  After the barge passed Operator brought the boat back up on plane and attempted to re-enter the Inter Coastal Waterway and continue her route back into the Arroyo Colorado river.  Operator's boat struck the #5 green channel marker on the way back into the channel.  

The #5 channel marker is a non-lit Day Board.    Occupant1 and Occupant2 were both thrown over the bow of the boat both striking the channel marker.  Occupant2 was recovered from the water complaining of extreme back pain.  Occupant1 was recovered from the water with a severe head injury, awake but not alert.  Occupant2 later died as a result of his injuries.  

At the time of the accident the, Game Wardens inspected the vessel and found that the navigation lights were not working.  There was a blown fuse at the helm that was for the navigation light system.  A battery powered lantern was taped to a flounder gig and secured to the center console.  This placed the light just left of the operator and at or slightly above eye level.  The lantern would have no doubt limited the operator’s ability to see objects in the forward path of the boat.  

In addition the distribution of the passengers around the operator would have contributed to Operator not being able to see the channel marker.  

Game Wardens also found that the hydraulic steering was leaking fluid and had a busted cap at the helm.  The hydraulic steering was responsive but required more than the designed number of turns to elicit a response when making a turn.  An inspection of the striations on the fiberglass of the boat and the transfer marks on the channel marker do not indicate any type of avoidance maneuver prior to the collision.  Operator never saw the marker and struck the channel marker at 5 to 15 degree angle of impact.

The dispatcher advised that no one was injured in the accident, but that it involved one of their officers and they provided me with his contact info.  I contacted the officer (Operator2) and he advised that both vessels and all persons involved were at the Nolin Sate Park Boat Ramp.  
     I arrived at the boat ramp at approx. 22:55 CST, and made contact with Operator2.  Operator2 advised that he and his passenger (V2 occupant) were headed up the lake in his bass boat when they suddenly noticed a boat in front of them.  Operator2 turned his steering wheel to the right to avoid hitting the other boat in the rear, but in doing so caused the starboard (right) rear side of his boat to strike the port (left) rear side of the other boat.  Operator2 then pulled around the other side of the boat he hit and turned on his docking lights to check on the other boat.  Once Operator2 and V2 occupant determined there wasn't any injuries, they asked the other boat ""where are your lights"".  Operator2 and V2 occupant stated that a male passenger on the other boat then moved an American flag to reveal the stern light, which was on.  
     I then spoke to the operator (Operator1) of the other vessel, a pontoon boat with seven passengers.  The first thing the Subjects expressed was how fast the bass boat was going.  The Subjects then stated that they were out just idling along enjoying the stars, when they heard a boat coming up behind them and before they knew it, the boat had hit them.  All occupants of the pontoon boat had similar statements of how they heard the boat coming from behind and being hit with no warning.  Subject1 stated he noticed the boat approaching quickly and thought it would hit them directly in the rear, and he began to holler but the engine from the bass boat was too loud and he didn't think the other boat heard him.  
     I interviewed operator1 and husband, and they both stated that their navigation lights were working and were not obstructed.  They advised me that their lights had quit working shortly after the accident, but showed me where the flag was hanging from the back of their boat.  From what I saw it did not appear that the flag could have obstructed the view of the stern light.  All occupants of the pontoon expressed great concern about the speed of the bass boat.  Written statements were taken from all the occupants of the Subjects vessel.
     I then interviewed Operator2 and  V2 occupant and asked about their speed of travel.  Operator2 advised he was on plane and typically while on plane he runs about 60mph during the daylight and about 40 mph when its dark.  Operator2 and V2 occupant both advised that they did not see any lights until after the collision, but agreed they were on and didn't think they would have had time to react to turn them on if they had been off.  I asked Operator2, when did he realize that there was a boat in front of him.  He and V2 occupant think that their front navigation lights lit up the back of the pontoon and then they realized a boat was in front of them.  Written statements were taken from both Operator2 and V2 occupant. 
     I interviewed both parties again the next day and their statements stayed the same.  The Subjects say their lights were on and unobstructed, but the bass boat was traveling way too fast.  The Subjects did advise they were having electrical issues with their vessel after the accident and now it would not run at all.  Operator2 admitted he was on plane, but did not see any lights until after the accident when he thinks someone moved an American flag to reveal the stern light which was on.  
     It is my opinion that the primary cause of this accident was excessive speed for the light conditions.  The night of this accident, the lake was extremely dark with very little to no moon light.  Both parties agree that the navigation lights on the Subjects boat were on, and I did not see any evidence that the stern light was obstructed.  It is possible that Operator2 and V2 occupant were sitting so low in the bass boat on plane that they could have been looking upward at the back of the pontoon boat, due to such a close proximity.  This could have possibly caused the American flag to block the view of the stern light, but again the speed of Operator2's boat would  be the primary cause of the collision.",17-03-32074,NA,NA,NA

Statements of a fellow resident indicate that the Victim, was planning on removing his sailboat from the water due to the end of the boating season.  The boat was docked at the pier on the seminary property.  The Victim is known to be an experienced sailor.   

 Other witnesses report seeing the sailboat on the lake with a single occupant who was not wearing a life jacket.  One witness reports seeing the operator of the sailboat struggling to control the boat due to the wind and waves.  The caller reported that she thought she heard sounds and possibly saw someone swimming from an object, possibly a paddle board.  That witness retrieved binoculars and was then unable to see anyone nor hear any further noises.  She then called 9-1-1.

The first arriving officers utilized a resident's boat and found that the paddle board was actually an overturned sailboat.  Additional resources were summoned and a search of the lake was conducted for the operator with negative results.  Meanwhile, at the seminary, investigation revealed that the Victim was missing.  

At about 4:30pm, the search transitioned to a recovery effort.  The effort was suspended at dark, about 5:45pm.  The next morning, the recovery effort resumed.  WDNR Officer located an anomaly with side-scan sonar at about 9:46am, and was able to confirm finding a body utilizing a remote camera.  The body was brought to the surface by the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department Dive Unit, and turned over to Waukesha County Medical Examiner.  The body was positively identified by seminary colleagues.  

The sailboat was recovered from the lake and transported to the Summit Police Department.

On July 29th, 2017 at about 5:00 PM, Vessel 1 displaying TX1067 CR, was reversing from a beach head in an area know as the ""Ski Basin"" in Corpus Christi, Texas.  There was a passenger in the rear of the vessel warning swimmers the boat was backing up.  The swimmers did not clear the area in time and one swimmer was struck leaving a series of cuts down her leg.  The operator  stopped the boat at the accident scene for approximately 40 seconds then proceeded to leave the area.  The swimmer was removed from the water and witnesses provided wound care until emergency responders could transport her to the hospital.  The swimmer received numerous stitches to multiple lacerations and was released from the hospital.

Operator told me that on 06 May 2017 at approximately 0645 hours while leaving Beach Marine in Jacksonville Beach he struck two crab pots. There was a slight vibration when underway so Operator slowed the boat and the vibration went away after a short while.

On 07 May 2017 while transiting from Hammock Resort in Palm Coast, FL to Halifax Harbor in Daytona, FL the vibration returned.  While at Halifax Harbor Operator had a diver check the bottom of the boat.  The diver found line around the starboard shaft and cut it free.

On 08 May 2017 while transiting to Titusville Municipal Marina the vibration continued.  Operator contacted Boaters Edge for advice, in which he suggested a sea trial.  On 9 May 2017 a sea trial was conducted and subject confirmed that it was the port shaft that was bent.

At the time of my investigation the vessel had already been repaired.  Once Operator received the final invoice it was over $2,000.00.  Operator completed a US Coast Guard Boating Accident Form and contacted FWC to complete appropriate forms.

Both units traveled via code response to Goose Bay Marina Duty station in Charles County to assist additional rescue efforts already underway. While en route, we were notified that the vessel was completely sunk and that both persons were in the water and wearing life jackets.  Upon arrival at Goose Bay, we were met by multiple people at the dock informing us that all rescue efforts were complete and subjects were transported to the hospital for observation.

Ofc. and I traveled to Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg Virginia to interview the owner and operator of the vessel and his wife, the other occupant in the boat. Wife sustained bruises and injuries that required medical evaluation, Operator declined medical care.  I asked Operator the events of the evening and the following is the description of the events that evening:

Both individuals had been boating most of the whole day with a few other boat friends and were traveling back from Fitzies Marina in Breton Bay, St. Mary's County Maryland.  Wife wearing her life jacket, Operator was not.  Operator was the operator of the vessel, a 1990 31' Wellcraft Scarab (VA 1572 BE), at approximately 40 knots (his estimation) en route back to Rick's Marina in King George Virginia, following GPS tracks he had laid out previously.  Through a brief distraction or looking away, their vessel approached the rock pile and Spider Buoy in the middle of the Potomac River nearing buoy 19 heading up river.  

In an effort to avoid direct impact with the rocks, the operator turned the vessel hard to port while the stern of the vessel impacted the rocks.  Operator was ejected, while Wife was thrown about the interior of the vessel.  The boat continued a short distance until Wife could reach the controls to shut down the engines, and then Operator was able to swim to the boat while it drifted towards him.  

Upon entering the boat he put on his life jacket, his wife found her cell phone and called 911.  Operator tried to start the boat, one engine wouldn't start.  With the one engine that was able to run, he tried to make way to shore but the vessel was taking on too much water and choked out the other engine and the boat quickly sank.  Wife held her arm up out of the water with cell phone in hand to communicate with 911 dispatch their location in proximity to search helicopters and vessels in the area and were located.  Both individuals were rescued from the water and trasported to shore in Virginia. 

Wife sustained significant bruises to her arms and legs and received treatment at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg Virginia.  While questioning Operator, he admitted to consuming a few beers during the day prior to the accident.  Also he stated that normally Wife does not wear her life jacket, but for some reason on that excursion she felt things weren’t quite right and decided to put her’s on.

Conditions that night were clear, waters were mostly calm.  Operator claimed to be an active and frequent boat operator, and had been most of his life.

The vessel was located in about 20 feet of water and was towed via Boat US to about 4 feet of water near Virginia at coordinates N38d20.497 by W78d10.731.  Vessel owner has stated he will comply with removing the now hazard to navigation.

Charges have yet to be determined.  Nothing further to report.

All events happened in Charles County Maryland and Fredericksburg Virginia.

I received a dispatch from white county dispatch that there was an incident with the shafer queen and another boat.  Officer and i responded to indiana beach.  We docked our boat on the west side of the amusement park and walked in that way.  

We made contact with director of operations.  She stated that the shafer queen was on a tour and there was a boat anchored in the lake and that the shafer queen somehow caught the anchor rope of the other vessel and pulled it into the shafer queen.  She told me that she was told this by the driver.  She also stated that the incident happened around 1300 hrs.

vessel #2 owner  wrote that he and his wife were anchored in the middle of the lake towards the dam.  He stated that they noticed the shafer queen was turning close to them and wondered if it was going to hit them.  He then stated that it hit the front left side of their boat causing his boat to go towards the paddle wheels.  He untied the anchor from front cleat and pushed away.

After reading that i talked with operator1.  He stated that he must have caught the anchor rope of the boat and that the anchor rope was too long.  He also stated that they had to give way to the shafer queen as they are the less maneuverable boat.  I informed him a boat that is anchor is not maneuverable at all and that he needed to avoid the collision.  I told operator1 that i would get with him later after he finished his written statement.

We arrived by boat and docked at the ramp.  The boat was on their lift.  Officer took photographs of the boat and i asked to see the anchor line.  The anchor line was measured by laying it out on the dock alongside the boat.  It measured approximately 60 feet in length.  There was damage to the anchor line approximately 15 feet from the end that was tied to the boat.  On the rope, there was red paint transfer that would appear to be from the red paint on boat.  It appears that the rope was smashed between the two boats.  We left after gathering their information and told them to call when they got an estimate for the damage.

The following week i talked to subject and she stated that she received an estimate for the damage to their boat and she forwarded me the estimate.  I also spoke to operations director and she told me that operator1 quit the day of the crash.  They asked him to take a drug test per their company policy and he told them that he quit. The director stated that she is waiting for the company to send the insurance information to her and she would forward it to me.  I then went to operator1's residence and dropped off an operator's report form for the accident.  I informed him that it needs to be filled out and sent back in within 24 hours.  He stated ok.

The vessel was a 10 foot 1996 yamaha  wave runner personal watercraft displaying the registration of nc 5603 cr.  The tube being pulled by the personal watercraft collided with a nearby pier ejecting all three males on board.  

Operator was operating the personal watercraft while puling a tube.  Operator was pulling the young males on the tube in a circular pattern.  Operator operated the personal watercraft approximately twenty feet from a nearby pier.  The total length of the rope that was connected to the personal watercraft and the tube was a total of 52 feet and 5 inches in length. This action caused the tube to swing wide and to the right colliding with the pier.  

Tuber1 was sitting on the right side of the tube and took the blunt force of the impact with the pier.  Tuber1 was unresponsive.  The other two occupants on the tube were able to get tuber1 out of the water with the help of tuber1’s father whom witnessed the incident and hurried over operating another personal watercraft.  Tuber1 was pulled from the water and onto the pier.  Witnesses stated that tuber1 was not sure where he was or what day it was.  Stanly county ems arrived on scene.  Tuber1 was transported to northeast medical due to his mother's request.  According to the mother of tuber1, tuber1's injuries consisted of a broken leg and a contusion to his lung.  Tuber1 was released two days later from northeast medical hospital and is continuing physical therapy.

Tuber2 age 18 was a passenger riding in the middle of the tube.  He sustained a contusion to his upper right chest area.  On the day of the incident he initially denied medical attention.  The following day due to his injuries he called and requested an ambulance.  He was transported to the hospital where he stated he waited for three hours without being seen.  Tuber2 became frustrated and left before any medical treatment was administered.

Tuber3 age 14 was the third passenger riding on the left side of the tube.  He received no injuries during the boating incident.

 upon my arrival on the scene, i began speaking to and observing operator.  Based on his demeanor, field sobriety test, and his admittance to drinking alcohol prior to the incident, i made the determination to arrest him for operating a vessel while being under the influence of an impairing substance.     It is my findings that operator's impairment and careless and reckless and negligent operation of the personal watercraft caused the personal injury to two of the three individuals that were riding on the tube when it collided with the pier.
 
Damage was found on the pier  at the same location where the tube made contact.  After talking to the owner of the pier, he advised no additional damage was done to the pier due to the this incident.

The total length of the rope that was connected to the personal watercraft and the tube is a total of 52 feet and 5 inches in length.

I do not have the operators 4.1. He has requested i take the 4.1 form and drop it off at his attorney's office so he could review it.  

All safety equipment was accounted for.  No safety equipment violations were found.

I arrived on scene at 0901. Upon arrival I made contact with one of the passengers aboard the vessel. Subject1 stated that the two other occupants of the vessel had been transported to seek medical attention. The other passenger was transported to Dorchester Hospital with a broken heel. The owner/ operator was flown out to Bay View Hospital in Baltimore for second degree burns on 15 percent of his body.

 OFC responded to Dorchester to get a statement and information, while CPL responded to Bay View to meet with Operator. Upon hearing of the injuries I called the DO for the Day LT, to see if it was something that should be turned over to SOD. The determination was made that it would not be necessary to turn it over. 

 I began my interview with Subject1 and asked if he felt comfortable giving a statement about the events that occurred, he stated that he would prefer if I wrote it down for him. Subject1 said that his brothers and he were about to take the boat (a 1993 Ken Craft, MD 7174C) out on a fishing trip. Operator wanted to check the oil before the trip began. Subject1 stated that the cover was off the motor for roughly 15-20 minutes while Operator checked the oil and other things around the motor.  The cover was closed before the vessel was started. Operator backed the vessel off of the lift and was reversing out. Once Operator put the vessel in forward Subject1 stated he heard a loud explosion and a fire broke out. Subject1 stated that the explosion was powerful enough to flip the engine cover over, which he said weighed around forty pounds. 

 Subject1 had to rush to the port side of the vessel and pull Subject2 back into the boat. The explosion nearly knocked Subject2 completely off the boat and into the water. Subject1 said he went into the cabin of the vessel and grabbed three life jackets. All occupants put on their lifejackets on and jumped from the vessel. Subject1 stated that they swam ashore and someone called 911. Subject1 also stated that they had just filled the vessel up with 40 gallons the night prior. 

 At 0940 Cambridge Fire Department arrived and set up a pollution ring around the vessel to contain any gas or oil leaks. 

 All events occurred in Dorchester County.

Upon arrival I observed a 32' Blackfin Sport fishing vessel aground on a sandbar just West of ICW marker 114.  Long Beach Township Beach Patrol were on scene and had previously assisted the female passenger prior to her being transported to shore by a passing vessel.  The vessel was hard aground and oriented toward the North East.  The vessel was still occupied by the Operator.  

Operator 1 Stated in Effect-  I was traveling North in the Inter Coastal Waterway and strayed just outside of the red marker.  My chart indicated that there was sufficient water depth and I turned to correct my course.  I was traveling at approximately 20-25 knots when I hit the sandbar.  Passenger 1 was then thrown from her seat next to me and struck her head on the front of the boat.

Investigation Revealed-  Vessel 1 was traveling Northbound in the Intracoastal Waterway near marker 114a.  Operator 1 was not familiar with the area and drifted West of the main channel into a very shallow area.  Vessel 1 subsequently impacted a sandbar that at the time was approximately 1.5 feet below the waterline.  Vessel 1 then stopped abruptly and Passenger 1 was thrown from her seat at the helm over the console and into a section of aluminum scaffolding.  Passenger 1 sustained significant injury to her head and face.  

A Passing vessel from New Jersey Fish and Wildlife then assisted Long Beach Township Beach Patrol with transporting Passenger 1 to shore.  Passenger 1 was then transported to Southern Ocean County Hospital by Long Beach Township E.M.S.  Operator 1 did not report any injuries.  

Passenger 1 sustained a large laceration running from her forehead down toward her cheek and multiple facial fractures as a result of the impact.  Vessel 1 was subsequently transported by Operator 1 to Morrison's Marina in Beach Haven to be checked for damage.  Vessel 1 was not damaged during the incident.

Operator1 (V1) advised that he was “driving in circles” and that he did not know Operator2 (V2) was “idling” at the time.  Operator2 (V2) advised that he was at a “dead stop” at the time of collision.  The accident occurred when front of V1 collided with the left front of V2, at which point V1 went on top of V2.  

The bow eye of V1 contacted the top of V2 which resulted in an approximately eight inch crack just above the rub rail and breaking of the rearview mirror assembly on V2.  Operator1 (V1) advised that his speed at the time of collision was approximately 15 miles per hour.  After the accident both operators checked the damage to V2 and continued operation for the remainder of their rental time.  When they returned to Fly-N-High Waverunners Inc. FWC was contacted.  Operator2 (V2) advised that both operators were wearing their life jackets.  Both operators advised that neither was injured nor ejected during the accident.  Neither of the operators could give me the direction of travel of the vessels at the time of the collision.

I documented with photographs the damage to V1 and V2 with my agency issued camera.  The owner of the livery advised V1 had preexisting damage to the bow rub rail and did not consider the damage to be done by this collision.  The owner of the livery also advised that the damage to V2 was over $2000

I conclude that the bow (front) of V1 struck the port bow (left front) of V2 at an approximate angle of 270 degrees relative to V2 and speed consistent with the “15 miles per hour” stated by Operator1.  As to the discrepancy in the speed of V2 at the time of collision, I believe that in this situation the interpretation of “idling” and at a “dead stop” mean the same thing, as the nature of personal water crafts have some forward propulsion even if no throttle is used.

On Wednesday, July 12, 2017, at approximately 1700 hours, operator1 and occupant were traveling by water in a southeasterly direction, on their way back from their condominium to the Tierra Verde Marina Resort.

Operator2 was traveling in an easterly direction, on his way back from the Pass-A-Grill Marina to his residence.

The V1, after colliding with the V2, proceeded to travel unmanned in a northeasterly direction (counterclockwise), and then proceed in a westerly direction until it struck a seawall and dock. This is where the V1 came to rest, as its outboard engine broke-off the metal engine mount and fell into the water. 

The V2 operator stated that after the collision, when he got his bearings, he placed his vessel in reverse and was going to attempt to throw his U.S. Coast Guard approved throw-able type IV device however; a charter boat had already arrived and were in the process of retrieving both V1 occupants from the water. The charter boat proceeded to the Tierra Verde Marina, located at 100 Pinellas Bayway South in Saint Petersburg, Florida 33715 with V1 occupants.

 The V2 operator followed them to the marina, where Emergency Medical Services (EMS) would render aid.

The accident occurred just south of the Fort Myers Beach Pier, at approximate coordinates N26°27.041 W81° 57.394. V-2 was heading NW at approximately 30 miles per hour, while V-1 was traveling NE at approximately 20 miles per hour. V-1 failed to give way, and struck the port side of V-2. The impact resulted in both occupants of V-1 being ejected, causing injuries to the operator of V-1(dislocated wrist).

Conclusions: Based on statements, evidence, and information gathered to date I have concluded the following:

The operator of V-1 did not have any prior experience operating vessels, and had received minor instruction prior to the rental. The operator of V-1 also failed to maintain a proper lookout, and did not make corrective actions to avoid the accident, even though he was the give-way vessel. No signs of impairment were detected when speaking to the operator of V-1. The primary contributing factor to the accident was violation of a navigation rule (failure to maintain lookout/failure to give way), with a secondary contributing factor being operator inexperience. 

Based on statements from witnesses, I also find it likely that V-1 was being operated in violation of Florida Statutes that prohibit wave-jumping or reckless operation of a personal watercraft. Operator1 stated that he had a firm grip on the handlebars prior to the accident, and he believes that as he was torn from the jet ski his wrist was pulled out. He was transported to Health Park Medical Center by Fort Myers Beach Fire Rescue. The nurse tending to him stated that the injury would required him to be placed on sedatives prior to a doctor re-locating the wrist.

He told me that he was exiting the flats area of Redfish bay that meets the intracoastal waterway across from the old airport in Aransas Pass.  This area is just south of Ransom Channel near Hampton's boat ramp.  He told me that low water and not hitting the deep water cut caused him to hit hard sand and stopped his boat immediately.  He and the other two passengers were ejected.  A passing boater picked them up and took them to the Yacht Club bulkhead at the San Patricio County navigation district.

The following information was taken from Aransas Pass Police Report 1700006643-0 from Officer.  I spoke with Subject who was also on the boat at the time of the incident.  He advised that he was not injured, but confirmed that he was also ejected off the boat.  I did observe a small laceration to his right leg, but he refused medical treatment on-scene.  

Subject confirmed the operator of the boat at the time of the incident who was also the owner of the boat.  He advised me that Operator was driving and that Subject2 was sitting on the front seat (ice chest) when the crash occurred.  Upon arrival I first contacted Operator and he identified as the operator of the boat.  He advised that they were out in the ICW and ran aground causing all three to be ejected from the boat. 

He explained that he was returning to the Aransas Pass Yacht club for a fishing tournament and he was to close too the land for a low tide which caused him to hit the sand. Operator had several lacerations to his forehead area and was bleeding, but was alert, conscious, and advised that he did not  lose consciousness at any time during the incident. While speaking to him I did not see any signs of intoxication.  Operator was bandaged by Tri-County EMS on location and said he was going to Memorial Medical Center as well for treatment.  

Upon arrival Subject2 was laying on the bow of the boat  and had a towel on his forehead that there was some obvious blood coming from a visible laceration to his forehead.  Ofc. provided emergency care while waiting for EMS to arrive.  Ofc. advised me that there was more severe bleeding in the area that was not immediately visible to me.  

While Ofc. was caring for Subject2 I began gathering statements from the others, but I was not able to get a statement from Subject2 as to the chain of events.  Upon arrival the subjects involved in the crash were on a unidentified boat who I was told was passing by and picked up the subjects and called for medical assistance.  He lest before I was able to identify or get statements from him.  I arrived on location and contacted the subjects involved.  Officers assisted with emergency medical need of the patients.  Information was gathered from the subjects involved in the crash. Texas Parks and Wildlife was contacted as well as the City of Aransas Pass Harbor Master.  Tpwd Warden arrived and took lead on the investigation.  We went to the crash location where photographs were taken and the boat was able to be removed off the sand and was transported back to the owners residence by some friends of his.

Follow up to injuries:  Occupant sustained fractures to his head and will require surgery to repair tissue displaced from his scalp.  Operator sustained lacerations to the head and required stitches.

The operator of vessel 1 stated, he saw the approaching vessel 2, slowed down, and came to a stop. As vessel 2 continued to approach, vessel 1 operator stated they waived their hands to signal the other vessel.  Both vessels changed course and turned East in an attempt to avoid a head on collision. By turning East, both vessels were entering shallow water, which further restricted their maneuverability.

 At approximately 0930 hours, vessel 2 struck the port side gunnel of vessel 1 with its starboard side bow. Vessel 1operator stated, he ""drove forward to get out from under"" vessel 2.  Immediately during the collision the operator of vessel 2 was ejected from his vessel activating the engine kill switch.  The operator of vessel 2 was able to re-enter his vessel without injury.

Per the investigator's report the occupants had gotten themselves out and were now at the operators parents house by the time they called to notify law enforcement.  He responded to their location and was told by the operator that they had launched at Twin Bridges and drifted down the river.  They had just passed through a riffle and into a back eddy.  The operator put his 8hp Honda motor down and started turning to fish the eddy.  Both of the passengers were standing up in the boat as he made the turn.  During the turn, one of the passengers lost his balance and fell toward the starboard side of the boat, catching himself on the gunwale.  The other passenger fell at the same time and landed on top of the first passenger.  All that weight on the starboard side pushed the gunwale under water, causing the boat to swamp and go straight to the boat in about eight feet of water.

Within a short period of time, the smoke increased and began to consume the living quarters/bedroom area as well.  The owner/operator then attempted to locate his dog, last seen in the living quarters/bedroom area.  He was unable to do so because of the heavy volume of smoke.  As the smoke became worse very quickly, and just before being forced to jump off of the vessel, a good Samaritan in a passing vessel was able to help the two individuals off of the vessel.  The dog was never found.  The vessel, which then began to drift east/southeast in direction, subsequently rested on a sandbar and burned completely to the waterline.

     Operator stated he had just had a new outdrive put on his 28' United Marine Corp Walkaround boat.  He wanted to get some hours put on it so he went out to cruise around and do some fishing with Passenger.  Operator stated he fueled the vessel up at Royal Farms with 120 gallons of gas.  Then he put in at Rogues Harbor, where he noticed a strong odor of gas.  However the vessel started and they headed to Turkey point to fish.  The boat started running rough so Operator said he decided to head back to Rogues.  The vessel shut off out in front of Rogues Harbor, approximately a couple hundred yards.  While the vessel was adrift, Operator stated he started checking the motor to see what was wrong with it.  Operator stated he smelled a strong odor of fuel.  Passenger stated he kept trying to start the boat when Operator told him to, giving it more gas to get it start however the boat wouldn't start.  Operator had walked away from motor hatch and told Passenger to try starting it, and when Passenger turned the ignition, ""Boom"", the motor compartment burst into flames.  Operator tried to get a fire extinguisher out but couldn't so they both jumped overboard.  They both struggled to swim in their jeans and barely made it to Rogues Harbor.  

     Operator later found out that he suffered an heart attack from the swimming.  Passenger managed to get to Operator's truck and call 911.  Both were transported to Union Hospital.  Passenger was treated and released.  Operator was admitted for heart issues.

At approximately 1000 hrs on 5/29/17 NPS dispatch called me and informed me there was a houseboat with 18 people on board taking on water and sinking near buoy 84.  They stated it was Aramark rental houseboat T-51 I agreed to respond.

INVESTIGATION:

I arrived on scene just behind NPS Ranger.  Ranger was instructing all the occupants of the boat to put on their PFD's.  I noticed the rear right side of the house boat was noticeably lower in the water.  I pulled along side the rear left side of the vessel and boarded the houseboat and noticed the bilge pump was pumping out some water on that side.  I lifted the motor compartment covers and saw there was about 8 inches of water in the port side motor compartment and about 3 feet of water in the starboard side motor.  I retrieved my de-watering pump from my vessel and moved my vessel over to the starboard side.  I placed my de-watering pump in the starboard side motor compartment and began to pump the water out.

While it pumped out I spoke to one adult male on the vessel and was told they had had several mechanical issues with the boat throughout their trip.  He stated that they had noticed water in the starboard side motor compartment for a couple days but not this much.  He stated that they had been having trouble getting the starboard motor to run for several days but that they had never struck anything with the vessel.  He stated that on this day both motors had died and wouldn't run, likely due to the amount of water in the motor compartments.  He stated the person who had rented the vessel had taken their power boat in toward Bullfrog to get help because they could not raise anyone on the radio.

I continued the pump out the water waiting for Aramark to arrive with their chase boat and mechanic.  The Aramark employee arrived with the houseboat renter and he took over pumping out the motor compartment which was almost dry.  I asked Subject to fill out a witness statement as the houseboat renter and primary operator, which he did.

I confirmed with the Aramark employee that he was okay with staying and waiting for their tow vessel which was in route before clearing the scene.  The engines will have significant water damage.  It is unknown how or why the vessel was taking on water but it appears it may have had a constant leak that eventually overcame the bilge on the starboard side, which was not working.  This allowed the motor compartment to fill making the vessel unsafe and likely to capsize had it continued taking on more water.

He navigated his boat towards what he thought was a wave, but ended up being a pour-over that was in a calm area of the river, above the rapid.  He went into the pour-over and was ejected from his kayak.  He went underwater and was being recirculated in the pour-over.  

The victim still had his paddle in his hands and used it to push off at some point.  During this time he swallowed some water and lost consciousness.  The two guide boats were downriver waiting for the kayaks to come down.  The lead guide saw the victim floating downriver above the rapid and noticed he was not actively swimming or making any motion.  The second guide retrieved the victim, who was unconscious, from the water and immediately started to go to shore.  

Two clients, who were nurses, started checking the victim for signs of breathing and a pulse.  He had both, but they were weak and his breathing was shallow/labored.  They started to administer CPR, but was stopped because it was not needed, as he was breathing and had a pulse.  The two guides started to do a head-to-toe examination looking for any obvious signs of injury.  At this point, another rafting group came by, which had a medical doctor in the group.  He started to provide care and monitoring of the victim.  The victim regained consciousness after about 15-20  minutes.  

During this time the guides formulated a plan for an immediate evacuation downriver.  The victim was transferred onto a table/backboard onto a gear boat and treated for shock.  He was taken downriver to an evacuation point at Rogue River Ranch.  EMS were contacted and a request for a helicopter was made.  The victim's condition continued to improve, but he was still very unclear as to the events that proceeded and did not remember the day's events.  

He was changed into dry clothes and given some juice and a little food.  He was able to walk, with assistance, to the helicopter landing site.  The helicopter landed, the victim was put on a backboard and loaded up.  He was transported to Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford and released the next morning.

Unknown injuries at that time. I arrived on scene at South Moon Fish Camp, the nearest boat ramp and made contact with an occupant of Vessel 2 (V2) who had been brought back to the ramp by a Good Sam. While interviewing Montgomery, FWC Officers responded to the scene by vessel. They were able to assist both of the crashed vessels back to the ramp for further investigation. 

Vessel 1(V1) was cruising South on the St. John's River, after fishing in Lake George. 

Vessel 2(V2) was cruising North on the St John's River after just launching from the South Moon Boat Ramp. 

I interviewed each individual and was told the same description of the crash event.

Both vessels were on plane cruising 20-30 mph.

While V1 was cruising South, Operator1 came around a bend in the river and was closer to the eastern side of the river bank. He would be considered the ""give way"" to vessel traffic and he was on the wrong side of the river. V1 was cruising North along the eastern side of the river which would give V2 a stand on definition. V2 was traveling on the East side as is expected for vessel traffic.

When each operator realized they were on a collision course neither slowed or altered their heading. Operator1 stated he increased speed and attempted a heading change at the last second to avoid the collision. Operator1's direction change crossed the path of V2. V2 struck V1 sternward of the center console and ramped over the gunwale, crushing the starboard side and stern area of V1. The impact ejected both occupants of V2 into the river. V2's heading change caused it to continue toward the river bank and into the tree line, then coming to a stop. 

V2's occupants were able to swim back to the V2 and reboard. Both reported no serious injuries. V2 operator reported a back strain/sprain while being interviewed. He also stated if V1 had continued straight the collision may have been avoided.

V1 was able to be extracted from the river bank and was towed by the FWC vessel back to ramp.

Operator2 stated his back was starting to tighten up from the strain of the crash. He stated he was thrown against the steering control  console as he was ejected from the vessel. He was unaware at the time of the crash of being injured, but was beginning to feel stiffness in his back approximately and hour after the crash. When asked he refused EMS response to be checked.

According to Law Enforcement, the Operator of V1 reported to them that on this date and time he was pulling out from the boat ramp, turned to the right and proceeded to get his gear ready on his boat for crabbing.  He proceeded out away from the boat ramp, with his head down.  He did not see V2.

The Operator of V2, Operator2, told officers that he was heading in when he saw V1 coming directly at his starboard side.  Operator2 yelled trying to get Operator1’s attention but was unable to until V1 struck V2 on its starboard side.

Officers reported that the damage showed red paint transfer on the top of the starboard side of V2 as well as the seat being buckled where it is attached to the inside of the boat.  V1 had minimal damage to the bow above the water line consistent with the information that was provided by the Operators.

Operator1 admitted that he was aware he had hit V2.  He departed the area to go check his crab pots because he did not believe he caused any damage to V2.

Operator of the vessel #1 was approaching cement Marina wall with dock on the starboard side.  The operator forcefully pushed the throttle forward causing the vessel to lunge forward and ride up on sea wall causing gouging damage to the fiberglass on the bow and starboard side of the vessel as well bending the bow eye.  The operator immediately took vessel out of gear upon impact and the vessel slid into the water.  Operator of vessel #1 charged with failure to maintain control of a vessel to avoid an incident resulting in property damage.  

No injuries were reported.  Please note: Witness #2 advised that occupant #6 fell into the water, however this was not due to impact.

Occupant #3 was identified as the owner of the vessel.  Occupant #3 left immediately after the incident before law enforcement arrival.  Multiple attempts to contact occupant #3 were made that evening.  Upon making contact with Occupant #3 several days later, he advised that he was completing the repairs to the vessel himself.  I advised Occupant #3 to contact me with the damage repair costs.  Occupant #3 did not return follow up calls.  Upon making contact with him he state that is cost him $40 in fiberglass and Bondo to fix the damage.

Damages to the vessel included two deep, jagged lacerations to the fiberglass one of which was approximately 20"" x 4"" wide, the other approximately 10"". Damages also included scraping damage on gel coat from the cement sea wall as well as the bow eye being bent from impact with the wall.

We responded with emergency lights and sirens to the area and noticed United States Coast Guard to be on scene as well. We noticed two jet skis, one was on fire and one was occupied by two people. We asked the PWC with two males on it if there was any one else involved and they said there was not. 

Operator1 told us that he was driving the PWC when he began to feel the seat getting very hot. He then noticed brown smoke coming out of it and the hatch to the front compartment was hot to the touch. Operator1 then boarded another PWC and gave distance between the two PWC's. Soon after, the PWC was engulfed in flames and that's when Coast Guard was arriving on scene.

 The remaining fuel was burned off within a few minutes and the PWC turned upside down. Boat US was called and pulled the boat to the boat ramp in West Ocean City.

While in route a local charter boat, the ""GETSUM"" radioed over the VHF radio that they had the only occupant of the vessel on board their vessel. Writer and Cpl. met the ""GETSUM"" in the Rt 50 Speed zone. 

The operator of the overturned vessel was onboard. He stated that he had some minor scratches on his legs but didn't want to be treated by EMS. The operator transferred to vessel 832 and we continued back out to the area of the accident. The vessel was located almost at the east end of the south rock jetty. It was upside down on the rocks. The engine was intact. Operator stated that he was a member of Towboat US and requested that they respond to retrieve the vessel. Towboat US did respond and got the vessel off of the rocks and towed to the West Ocean City boat ramp.
 
Operator was taken to the boathouse so that his wife could pick him up. 

Operator related the following; He had been fishing the jetty for about an hour or so. The water was calm except for ground swells that would roll in from the ocean. These ground swells were not that big and caused no problems. Suddenly, one the ground swells came in that was larger than normal. The wave broke just before it reached his vessel. He saw this just as it happened. The breaking wave caused his vessel to overturn throwing him into the water. The vessel, even though overturned, remained floating and was washed on the jetty by another wave.

While following up on multiple vessel accidents on 9/14/17 due to a strong storm that moved through the area I located Houseboat Summer Star laying on its port side on the beach near the Sand King. I spoke with the owner and collected information for the boat accident report. The owner’s wife was transported to the Page hospital and received 6 staples for a laceration on her head from the accident as well as 12 stitches on a laceration on a foot.

INITIAL CALL:

At approximately 1330 hours on 9/14/17 I overheard NPS Ranger responding to what would be the first of many calls for service during a strong microburst storm. They were looking for a capsized houseboat across Wahweap Bay from the marina, possibly near the Sand King area. I am unsure if they ever located this vessel or spoke to the occupants.

On 9/15/17 I responded to the area looking for a capsized houseboat knowing that none of the responding officers the day before had time to take accident reports. I located the capsized Summer Star at approximately 1130 hours. I spoke with the owner and had him fill out a witness statement.  While he filled out the statement I surveyed the accident scene taking pictures as I went.  The houseboat was still laying on its port side and I could not safely gain access to the interior of the vessel to survey the damage further.  I located where two anchors had been pulled out of the ground on the vessels starboard side and photographed that as well.

I discovered there had been 19 people on the vessel at the time of the accident.  

Owner informed me his wife had been struck in the head by a trash compactor during the capsizing and that they had taken her to the Page Hospital where she received 6 staples for the laceration.  She also had a laceration on her left foot that received 12 stitches.  He stated there were some bumps and bruises on other passengers but nothing requiring medical attention.  

Owner stated that the wind had not only pulled up the anchors  but he had also been trying to use the motors to keep the boat straight on shore but was unable to due to the wind strength.  The strength of the wind was just too much for the anchors to hold and when the vessel turned sideways to the beach with likely great force it turned over on the sandy beach on its port side.  Owner stated he had tow service people coming to help turn it back over.

I was unable to survey the majority of the damage since the most damaged side of the vessel was on the beach and I could not enter the houseboat safely with it on its side.  I expect significant damage to the port side of the vessel and to the interior of the vessel from large items falling.

I gave Owner my contact information for the report and cleared the scene at approximately 1200 hours.

VOLUNTARY WITNESS STATEMENT: 
Extreme winds blew houseboat sideways against the beach. Our efforts to keep it straight with engine power were futile. 19 total people were on the boat and got out with bumps and bruises. My wife suffered the most injuries with the trash compacter to the head (6 staples, and also a cut on her left foot, andreceived 12 stitches. Wind pulled all the anchors out and boat was blown down the beach 30 feet.",R870071,NA,NA,NA

The operator of the vessel attempted to change direction at the first green buoy outside of the inlet. During the course change towards the port side, the single outboard motor on the vessel failed and left the vessel adrift. As the bow of the vessel drifted west, the vessel began taking large waves over the stern and began to capsize. The two passengers donned Type 2 life jackets and entered the water before the vessel became completely submerged and rolled over in the wake. A passing recreational vessel was able to recover one of the passengers safely and the other passenger (the operator) was safely recovered by the United States Coast Guard. The vessel was towed by SeaTow to Jim Barry boat ramp where it was recovered. Vessel damage is estimated at approximately $5,000.

According to VICTIM's wife he was an experienced whitewater kayaker with many year’s experience and had paddled this particular section on numerous occasions.

 VICTIM had launched at approximately 1515, his exact location of launch is unknown since there were no witnesses. A note was left in the truck when VICTIM’S WIFE picked it up stating that he launched at 1515 and expected to be at Alvarado at 1715. During his float down the creek, VICTIM came upon an old dam that stretched the width of the creek. According to witnesses “VICTIM assessed (viewed) the dam and went over the dam on the right side of it at approximately 1614. After VICTIM went over it, Witness1 observed “VICTIM disappear and not come right back up and then was observed to be struggling.” 

At this time, approximately 1615, Witness1 ran to a neighbor’s house to have them call 911 and went to get a yard rake to possibly help VICTIM out of the water. Witness2 observed “VICTIM churning under the falls and went down the river”, while witness1 went to the neighbors. 

Another witness observed, “VICTIM “bob” to the surface at least two times with his head face down in the water.”  When Witness1 got back (after going to neighbors) VICTIM was observed by all three witnesses (floating down the middle of the creek face down). 

VICTIM floated down the creek approximately 100 yards until he got caught on a rock in the center of the creek. He remained caught on the rock until EMS personnel retrieved his body. His body was clearly visible from the bank as he was wearing a yellow shirt, an orange personal floatation device and a green helmet. 

Officer was notified via the WCSO of the incident and immediately notified Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) dispatch at 1625. The first DGIF unit arrived on scene at 1654, with the others arrived within minutes. The Glade Spring Life Saving Crew Special Operations Team launched a life raft at approximately 1730 and was successful in recovering the body and quickly getting it to the bank. At approximately 1756 VICTIM was pronounced dead at the scene by Damascus Rescue. Officers recovered the Kayak downstream.  The cause of death was determined to be drowning.

After fishing from the pier at Lake Houston Marina, they all decided to go out in Operator's boat.  Operator was in front, Occupant1 (victim) was in the middle, and Occupant2 was in the back.

They took their one man kayak to cross pylons underneath the bridge from the Lake Houston Marina to the roadside for better fishing.  They crossed the pylons and fished at that location until 2:30 am when they loaded up and decided to come back.

At approximately 2:30 am (7/29/2017), they felt a strong wind that was making the boat rock and the water was getting choppy.  The boat then started rocking and all three were tipped towards the port side flipping them over.  Occupant2 was in front swimming to the shore, Operator was in the middle swimming towards the shore, and Occupant1 (victim) was behind them.  Operator stated he heard Occupant1 (victim) stating he couldn't swim anymore; that he was getting tired.  He stated he said to Occupant1 to keep swimming and he was getting tired as well.  Operator stated he then went on his back floating up and looked to see Occupant1 (victim) still swimming.  Operator stated he then started swimming again and when he looked back again, Occupant1 (victim) was not visible anymore.

Houston Police Department arrived on scene at 0258 hours and met with Houston Fire Department units who were already on scene.  They gathered the information from Operator and Occupant2.  HFD transported both Operator and Occupant2 to Northeast Memorial to get checked out.  Both were cleared and brought back to the scene.

Occupant 1 received second and third degree burns on 10%-15% of his body. The Operator received first and second degree burns on 5% of his body. 

As V1 was traveling down the channel Victim3 opened the door to the cuddy cabin and stuck his head in to get out of the wind so he could light a cigar. Victim3 struck his lighter and ignited fuel vapors that had been trapped in the cabin from the recent fuel up. The vapors traveled through an open hole next to the sink and into the wall of the cuddy cabin. The ignition continued inside the wall down into the decking of the vessel just above the fuel tanks causing a large explosion onboard the vessel. 

The explosion removed the fiberglass decking from the floor and threw it out of the vessel to the port side. The force of the explosion knocked Victim2 off balance and into the water on the starboard side. As the flames exited the cuddy cabin they engulfed Victim3 and reached Operator burning both men severely and knocking Victim3 backward on top of the now exposed fuel tanks. 

Operator quickly acted and grabbed his two fire extinguishers as most of the fire was gone but a small flame still burned on top of the port tank from Victim3's burning hat and was able to extinguish the flame. A good Samaritan vessel was cruising by and pulled Victim2 from the water. They then retrieved Operator, Victim3, and victim2 from the vessel and took them back to Stock Island Village Marina.

When the PWC was first observed by a Tow Boat US Captain the vessel exhibited extensive damage to its port side and bow. Additionally, floating debris still surrounded the vessel. A Miami-Dade Fire Rescue (MDFR) boat responded to the scene and initiated search patterns in the vicinity of the bridge. Within a short period of time MDFR recovered the body of a Hispanic male near the drifting vessel. It was later confirmed that he was the only person on board. 

The victim was identified. An autopsy completed at the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department determined that the cause of death was blunt force head injury with terminal submersion in water. Additionally, the toxicology report revealed that Operator had an ethanol concentration of 0.160% (blood) and 0.183% (ocular) as well as 0.488 mg/L of cocaine (blood). 

On February 5, 2017 Operator left Pelican Harbor Boat Ramp shortly before the accident in an effort to contact his friends (who were underway on a separate boat). Operator intended to recover his car keys and wallet. Operator and his girlfriend had spent the day in the water together. But, upon returning to the boat ramp, already after sunset, (sunset time: 6:08 PM)  both realized that their car keys and wallets were forgotten on their friend's boat. According to Girlfriend, she asked Operator not to return to the water and gave him different options but since he was unable to make contact with his friends, he insisted and got underway from the boat ramp. This occurred a few minutes before 10:00 PM. See attached sworn written statement provided by Girlfriend. 

An extensive search of the area was conducted in an effort to located the exact point of impact. All day beacons/markers within close proximity of the bridge were inspected as well as a closely located ""Slow Speed Manatee Zone"" sign. We search for any marks or indications of impact with negative results. However, due to the close proximity of the PWC to the bridge at the time that it was found and the immediacy of the debris to the floating vessel, it is possible that the impact occurred near the span of the bridge positioned directly west of the ICW, where the vessel was initially observed drifting. 

The operator of the Personal Watercraft (PWC) involved in the accident suffered the following fatal injuries after a collision with an unknown fixed object at a high rate of speed on February 5, 2017 at approximately 10:00PM:  Blunt injuries of head and neck: Abrasions of face and neck; laceration of face; subscalpular hemorrhage and subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.   Blunt injuries of torso: Abrasions of chest and abdomen; right rib fractures; bilateral hemothoraces and small lacerations of liver.   Blunt injuries of extremities: Abrasions and lacerations; fractures of left distal femur; fractures of left tibial head.   Froth in mouth and trachea; bilateral pulmonary edema and fluid in sphenoid sinus.   This information was obtained from the autopsy report completed by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department.

I called for help on my VHF and you guys got here really quick.""

Investigation Revealed:  Vessel #1 was under way in a westbound direction in the Metedeconk River, Brick Township, at which time the forward portion of the outboard engine lower unit struck the vessel's protruding one-way bilge plug causing a crack to same. The lower unit was found to be positioned one inch from the plug upon my inspection of the vessel once it was removed from the water, and investigation determined that the two came into contact with each other as a result of normal wave action while under way. The cracked plug then allowed water to rapidly enter the vessel, causing it to begin flooding. Upon observing water entering his vessel, Operator #1 turned the vessel around to an eastbound direction in hopes of making it back to the boat ramp. The vessel continued to flood and eventually capsize in the Metedeconk River. Both occupants were then rescued by first responders prior to entering the water, and the vessel was pumped out by commercial salvage thereby preventing it from sinking. 

This Boating Accident Investigation was determined by physical inspection of Vessel #1 once it was pulled from the water, observation of the damaged bilge plug, the vessel's final rest position, and Operator #1 statements.

As EMS monitored Operator's vitals, I asked permission to ask Operator a few questions. Both EMS and Operator consented. I asked Operator if he had remembered what had happened. Operator stated he was traveling about 25 mph when he had to turn hard to prevent colliding with another vessel. He stated the steering stuck and he just went into the mangroves. I asked Operator if he remembered what happened to his head. Operator stated he struck it on the center console. I asked Operator if he knew what he was going to do with the vessel. I advised Operator that it was approximately 50 feet deep into the mangroves, and it would more than likely require a professional salvage. Operator stated he did not know what he was going to do. I advised him of Sea Tow and Tow Boat US as a starting point. I then asked Operator if there was anything on board that he absolutely needed or was in fear of losing. Operator then stated that his dog, ""(dog’s name)"" was still on board. Operator stated that his keys were also on board with his wallet. Operator asked if we could locate his dog, to grab his keys and wallet and put them in his camper at Coral Sands Campground. EMS transported Operator to Mariner's Hospital, in Tavernier. Officer and I returned to the scene of the crash. 

   At approximately 1630, Officer and I arrived back on scene of the crash. We nosed our patrol vessel up to the mangroves and I began to call out for ""(dog’s name)"". After a minute or two I removed my boots and duty belt and began to climb back through the mangroves to vessel. At this time, Everglades National Park Rangers arrived on scene as well. As I approached the vessel, I was able to see a dog carrier under the center console. A small dog poked his head up from the carrier. With the assistance of a Park Ranger, we were able to recover (dog’s name) and Operator's wallet and keys. I was able to better photograph the vessel, damage to the mangroves and document the pathway the vessel entered into the mangroves. Freshly snapped mangroves along with blue hull paint transfer were indicative of the crash.  I was also able to confirm the vessel as the same one from the morning prior, bearing FL 0495 GA. 

   At approximately 1745 hours, I arrived at Mariner's Hospital in Tavernier. With permission from the emergency room staff, (dog’s name) was turned over to Operator in the ER.

V2 had a lower unit malfunction causing the motor to be inoperable. V1 was towing V2 at approximately 6 M.P.H to Sea Hag Marina to drop off their harvested fish to be cleaned for the occupants of V2 mentioned above. 

Operator2 had called Sea Hag Marina prior to arriving and requested the fueling dock be cleared of boats to make a safe docking area for V1 and V2. 

Upon arrival V3 was refueling at the fueling dock. V1 did not attempt to dock on the outer portion of the fueling dock as V3 was refueling. V1 then attempted to travel further up the river and turn into the inner portion of the fueling dock where there was a two-vessel docking area. With the current pushing out into the Gulf of Mexico V1 began to make the turn into the inner portion of the fueling dock where the two-vessel docking area was. As V1 turned into the inner docking area V2 began to drift into the bow of V3. 

V3 has a long anchor pulpit that was at the end of the outer fueling dock. Operator2 then realized that impact with V2 and V3 was imminent and braced his hands onto the anchor pulpit of V3. 

Two people assisted Operator2.  V2 then collided at the anchor pulpit of V3, with V3 colliding at the center console’s windshield of V2. Operator2 fell onto the floor of V2 and victim’s hand was caught in-between V2’s windshield frame, and V3’s anchor pulpit. V2’s windshield frame bent and the plex glass windshield broke cutting victim’s hand. 

Operator1 then put V1 into neutral allowing slack in the tow line, giving subject enough room to push off V3. V1 and V2 then floated with the current into the inner fueling dock where Sea Hag Marina employees were waiting assist.

On August 11, 2017 at approximately 1715 hours Operator was operating a personally owned 31’ Boston Whaler cabin motorboat with 5 other occupants on board approximately ½ mile south of Lois Key in Monroe County, Florida. The vessel was in forward gear at idle speed while the occupants were looking into the water for lobster when Subject1 exclaimed he saw lobster from the bow of the vessel. Subject1 grabbed his snorkeling gear and jumped in the water from the port side mid ship and began swimming away from the vessel looking for the lobster. 

Two people were at the stern of the vessel behind Operator and began putting on their snorkeling gear as well. Operator maintained eyes on Subject1 and put the vessel in reverse gear at idle speed to get closer to Subject1. As Subject1 was swimming away from the port side mid-ship of the vessel and the vessel was at idle speed in reverse, Victim exited the vessel off of the starboard stern and into the vessels path of travel. The propellers hit Victim causing several lacerations to the right side of her body including a laceration near the groin severing her femoral artery.

We were advised that a sailboat had struck another vessel and had left the scene. We were provided with a description of the striking vessel, white sail boat displaying MD Registration 7785BP and towing a yellow dingy. When we arrived on scene we met with subject who advised us that he tried to confront the other boater as he left the scene, and he believes he was intoxicated
 
 DNR Communications advised us that the striking vessel was seen at Annapolis City Marina. Cpl. and I left back creek and proceeded to Annapolis City Marina to find the Striking Vessel. When we arrived we did not see the vessel in question. We stopped at the Marina to ask the personnel if they had seen a vessel matching the description. The Marina manager said “yes he just left about 10 minutes ago and he said he was going to return to back creek”.
 
 Cpl. and I returned to Back Creek and noticed a sailboat trying to anchor. We approached the vessel because it matched the description that we were given. 

We made contact with the vessel owner. We asked Operator2 was he involved in any collisions and he replied “no I was not”. Operator2 stated that his sailboat was dragging anchor while he was at work but he is unaware of it striking another vessel. Operator2 provided me with his identification, vessel registration, and proof of insurance. Operator2 was advised that there were photos taken of his vessel striking Vessel1.
 
 Cpl. boarded Operator2 vessel in search of any evidence to support v1’s allegations of him being intoxicated. There was an open bottle of an alcoholic beverage on the seat in the stern. Cpl. ask Operator2 how much alcohol has he consumed today, Operator2 responded “I took 3 shots in 15 minutes”.

Operator2 was instructed to drop his anchor and not to operate his vessel if he was going to keep consuming alcohol. Operator2 agreed to drop his anchor.
 
 Cpl. and I believe that Operator2 was under the influence of alcohol; however we did not see him operate his vessel so we could not charge him.
 
 No one was charged in this case.

The accident transpired approximately 100 yards off of the island located in front of blue jay point county park in raleigh, north carolina.  Vessel one was a 20 foot nautic global sweetwater pontoon boat owned by motor-boatin llc rental company but was being operated by 47-year-old.  Vessel two was an 18 foot godfrey hurricane deck boat.  The vessel was owned and was operated by 47-year-old. 
     
Vessel one was traveling east on falls lake toward falls dam at cruising speed.  Vessel two was anchored adjacent to blue jay point.  Their bow pointing east, and was preparing to fix some sweet tea when they heard a vessel approaching.  They looked up to see vessel one approaching the stern directly on with their bow.  Vessel two passengers started yelling and waving their hands to try to get the attention of vessel one.  Vessel one's operator stated he looked ahead when he heard yelling.  Operator1 stated he then saw vessel two and abruptly steered to the left to try and avoid hitting vessel two.  Vessel one's starboard side float log struck vessel two's port side stern causing fiberglass damage.
 
We were patrolling on falls lake when we rounded the bend to find the two vessels flagging us down.  We were able to provide assistance directly after the collision, helping to get everyone back safely, and assuring no one was injured. 
    
Upon investigation, Operator1 was charged with g.s. 75a-10(a) “operating a vessel in a reckless or negligent manner so as to endanger life, limb, or property of any person” resulting in this accident.  No one was injured and no drugs or alcohol was involved.  It is my opinion that operator inexperience and inattention was the result of the accident.

Officer1 said there were two individuals on board the watercraft a 43 foot sail boat.  They had been taking the sail boat from Chicago to Larson Marina for winter storage.  Upon entering the harbor the operator at the time hit the northern sea wall with the starboard side of the sail boat.  After the impact the owner who was also on board at the time took control of the boat and negotiated the sail boat to its slip.  Officer1 informed me he believed Operator was under the influence of intoxicating compounds and asked if I wished to pursue Operating Under the Influence (OUI).

The next day I contacted Owner and asked him to describe the events which took place in the evening hours of 10/27/17.  Owner said himself and Operator had taken the sail boat from Chicago to Larson marina for winter storage.  He had Operator operate the vessel since he was a USCG licensed captain and a competent sailor.  There were no issues on the trip from Chicago to Waukegan.  Owner said it was not until they dropped the sails and prepared to enter the harbor that Operator''s demeanor seemed to change.  Owner reported Operator seemed confused as to where the harbor was at and then upon entering the harbor he began crowding the northern sea wall, despite Owner''s concerns.  Owner said there was no boat traffic in the harbor at the time and could not understand why Operator would not navigate closer to the middle of the channel, Operator claimed it was the wind.  Operator failed to make any corrective action and the sail boat struck the northern sea wall.  At this time Owner said he took over operation of the vessel and took it to the slip at Larson marina.

On july 08, 2017, at approximately 17:00 hours eastern time, operator of vessel 1 (1983 16' glassmaster (nc 3942-ay), was attempting to load vessel 1 onto the trailer which was backed into the water on the boat ramp.  

Upon initial approach, operator1 decided rather than continue to load vessel 1 onto the trailer, she would prefer backing up, and reattempting her approach.  For better positioning on the trailer. Operator1 stated that she shifted into reverse and turned the steering wheel to the left, thus turning the bow of the boat to the right.  Upon shifting the gear into forward, operator1 stated that the throttle became stuck in the forward gear at which time, vessel 1 traveled forward at a slow speed and struck the stern of vessel 2 on the port side.  Vessel 2 was moored to the dock and unoccupied at the time of the incident. Vessel 2 was a 1997 24' suncruiser.  V2 owner was contacted by lake hickory marina and arrived on scene shortly thereafter.  Immediately after the collision, operator1 turned the engine off and took the throttle out of gear.  

As a result of the collision, vessel 1 sustained damage to the starboard side of the bow, where the rubber guard strip and the fiberglass hull impacted vessel 2. 

Vessel 2 sustained damage to the port side stern, where the aluminum siding and the pontoon were impacted by vessel 1.  

Upon further investigation, the linkage on the throttle of vessel 1 seemed to be somewhat stiff and difficult to shift into and out of gear.  The cause of the incident was determined to have most likely occurred as a result of the throttle of vessel 1 becoming stuck in the forward gear.  Video surveillance at lake hickory marina captured a recording of the incident on camera and everything appeared to have occurred as stated in the facts of the report.

At the same time Operator2 was operating a 2001 34'' Sea Ray 340 Sundancer, vessel 2, on Douglas Lake in Jefferson County. Vessel 1 was traveling upstream along the right side of the bank towards Swann''s Marina. Vessel 2 was also traveling upstream in the same area. 

A point, approximately .45 miles downstream of the mouth of Seehorn Creek, extends out to restrict upstream visibility of vessels traveling along the right bank. Vessel 1 was traveling beyond the point. Vessel 2 came around the point traveling in a plowing displacement mode, restricting the operator''s visibility. 

Operator2 never saw vessel 1. Upon hearing engine of Vessel 2, Operator1 attempted a starboard side maneuver in order to avoid collision. Vessel 2 made initial contact to vessel 1 on the rear cowling of motor. 

Vessel 2 then proceeded across the stern continuing towards and across port side of vessel 1. Vessel 1 banked right and traveled into the bank while vessel 2 maneuvered port side. Upon collision, Operator1 was ejected from vessel 1 and sustained injuries.  

Operator1 refused medical treatment.  Operator2 stated she circled back to ""see what kind of log she ran over."" This was the first time she saw vessel 1 and that she had not ran over a log but had collided with another boat.  Operator2 retrieved Operator1 from the water, and provided first aid to some of her injuries.  

Based on officer investigation and statements of parties involved Operator2 was at fault. With her vessel being large and sitting high above the water there is a restriction of visibility. Add that along with a plowing displacement where the front of the boat rides high and a point restricting the view there was a need for more operator attention than what was being used. 

Operator2 demonstrated improper lookout at a time where there were visibility restrictions with her vessel. She did not give way to the stand on vessel that she was overtaking. She also did not take early and substantial action to avoid a collision.

The original call was relayed to us from NPS Dispatch.

I located the boat involved at the Wahweap Boat Rentals. The center folding window was broken and I noted blood on the floor and on the passenger seat.

I interviewed the driver of the boat. He stated that after passing a tour boat that was moving in the opposite direction, he was surprised by the wake. He stated that the impact with the wake caused the window to break and his passenger to fall from her seat. She sustained cuts from the glass. OPERATOR stated he was at 3500RPM when he approached the wake and went to neutral when VICTIM fell. He stated that he did not slow for the wake. OPERATOR denied alcohol or drug involvement. OPERATOR was unfamiliar with the area but stated they had just left a no wake canyon and turned right. This fits the description of Antelope Canyon. OPERATOR had cuts to his hands, feet, and lower right leg that were non emergent.

I interviewed VICTIM at the hospital. She stated that they contacted the wake far from the tour boat after passing it. She was unable to give an exact location. VICTIM stated that the impact with the wake broke the glass and caused her to fall from her seat. She sustained cuts to her hands, feet and right leg, as well as pain in her left lower arm. 

VICTIM denied drug or alcohol involvement and stated that they were not purposefully jumping the wake. Her fiancé was present at the hospital and stated that as a boat instructor on those particular boats, 3500RPM was just up on plane at approximately half throttle.

I took pictures of the boat and received a written statement from OPERATOR.

Owen county water rescue team was in route to the scene and were requesting assistance.  

           i arrived on scene on or about 1810 hours.  By the time that i had arrived on scene, the water rescue team was already launching their boat and preparing to make the rescue.  They successfully retrieved all four victims from the water brought them over to ems units where i was able to interview them while they were being treated.  

All four victims had not sustained any injuries and refused transport to the hospital.  When asked what happened, operator1 stated that they had launched their kayaks from the road into the flood water.  He stated that they were kayaking out to his cabin that was only accessible by boat because of the flooding.  Operator1 said that the water was calm until they went around the bend.  He stated that they got out to far from the shoreline and they current was much stronger.  

He stated that operator3 was the first to flip over and was able to hold on to a tree to keep from floating down stream.  The other three subsequently flipped over and lost their kayaks trying to assist operator3.  Operator3 and operator1 were able to hold on to the tree until they were rescued.  Operator4 and operator2 were able to make it to shore and wait there until they were rescued.  Operator3 and operator4 were both wearing life vests. Operator1 and operator2 stated that they had life vests in the boat, but were not wearing them.

The victims were transported to Charles Regional Medical Center in Laplata, Maryland by Bryan’s Road Ambulances 118 and 119 and Indian Head Ambulance 98.
 
 On arrival at Charles Regional, Cpl., Off., and I interviewed the six victims. All presented approximately the same narrative for the day: in the early afternoon, they launched a small aluminum Jon Boat, Virginia registration 5927 BN, from the Hallowing Point community boat ramp in Lorton, Virginia. They navigated east to Pomonkey Creek, where the group went ashore, lit a fire, and fished.
 
Several members of the group attempted to return back across the Potomac in the afternoon, but were deterred by heavy seas and high winds. After sunset, however, the group thought that the wind had died down and attempted to return westbound across the Potomac to Hallowing Point
 
 A short distance from the Maryland shore, the operator of the vessel encountered heavy seas and the vessel began taking water over the bow. Water began to collect in the stern of the vessel. Operator slowed and ultimately stopped the vessel while his passengers attempted to find something to bail out the boat with. During that time, more water collected in the stern, ultimately capsizing the vessel.
 
 
The six victims clung to the hull of the vessel and used two operable cellphones to call 911 and their parents. After approximately 25 minutes, they were rescued by Fireboat 20 and brought to shore. All victims were transported to Charles Regional Medical Center, where they were treated for hypothermia. Four people were admitted briefly. One subject was also treated for aspirating a small amount of water. Two people were released on arrival. All subjects were ultimately released to their parents.

Operator's vessel was recovered and towed back to the Hallowing Point community boat ramp by Towboat US. I responded to that location and took pictures of the vessel (attached). I observed that the capacity plate had worn to the point that it could not be read; however, using a standard formula, I determined that the maximum capacity of the vessel should have been approximately five people.

 I observed no structural damage to the vessel. The attached Mercury outboard motor and various electronics may be damaged due to submersion.

All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland, and Fairfax County, Virginia

Information had been given to FWC Dispatch through the Brevard County Sheriff Office (BCSO) that two young males operating PWC's to the South West of SR 528 had collided with one another. Operator1 had struck the port side of Operator2 PWC resulting in Operator2 being ejected from the PWC and subsequently causing the PWC to sink. 
The owner of the PWC's and, Blu-Fin Boat Rentals, as he was preparing to remove the PWC's that were involved in the accident from the water. When I spoke with Owner he informed me that Operator1, and Operator2 were operating the PWC's for the first time while he was fueling up another vessel, Owner informed me that he told the boys to go down the barge canal and out to the river. 
A short time later Owner informed me that he saw Operator1 driving back on FL 7983NX with his bother, Operator2, on the back of the PWC. They contacted EMS, and Operator2 was transported to the hospital. 
Owner informed me that Operator1, and Operator2 were approximately 100 yards from SR 528 on the South West side where they were attempting to jump the wake of a passing vessel. Operator2 was traveling in an Easterly direction and Operator1 was traveling in an North Easterly direction at the time of the collision. 
Once Operator2 jumped the wake of the passing vessel Operator1's view was obstructed, this caused the PWC Operator1 was operating (FL7983NX), to strike the port side of Operator2s PWC (FL7981NX). 
Subsequently Operator2 was ejected from his PWC, which as a result from the collision capsized. Operator1 sustained a small laceration to his left ankle, and Operator2 was transported via EMS with a neck brace however it was later removed.;Operator1 sustained a gash on his left ankle due to his PWC impacting his brothers.;Operator2 sustained bruising and soreness due to his brothers PWC striking the port side of his PWC.

     The operator stated, to the effect, ""We were fishing offshore. The water was flat as could be. I felt a cool breeze on me and knew that meant bad weather was coming, so we decided to head to the bay. We put all the poles away and I was just about to start the engine when we got hit by a rogue wave. The boat was flooded, and then the next wave hit us and capsized the boat.""

     The investigation revealed that operator went fishing in his 1985 white Wellcraft Fisherman 18' open center console vessel with one passenger. They traveled out Absecon Inlet into the Atlantic Ocean. Operator estimated they were approximately three miles offshore when they decided to start fishing. They began drifting with the current. After fishing for a time, Operator realized the weather was turning bad and decided to move the vessel. Before he could start the engine, the vessel was hit with a wave that swamped the boat. Another wave subsequently capsized the vessel. Both occupants were thrown into the water, but managed to cling to the boat. Operator's cell phone was still functional despite being submerged, and he used it to call for help. Operator and Occupant continued to cling to the vessel until the US Coast Guard located the vessel. The two were removed from the water and returned to the US Coast Guard base in Atlantic City. The US Coast Guard turned the two boaters over to Atlantic City Rescue Mission upon arriving at the docks. Coast Guard personnel did not know where the two had been transported to after leaving the Coast Guard docks.

Information gathered supports a recreational vessel (v-1) was traveling northbound on Harney Pond Canal when a second recreational vessel, entered the canal from the west proceeding east. V-1 struck the starboard side of V-2. Operator2 and his passenger were transported  by EMS for evaluation and treatment.
The inertia carried by V-1 caused the lighter, flat bottomed V-2 to yaw away from V-1. V-1 was also forcibly turning away from V-2, causing secondary impacts to the hull and motor of both vessels during separation. The depth of the propeller marks on V-2 are deeper at its stern and lighten as they progress toward its bow. Also, V-2’s factory welds at its gunwale are torn near its stern. The damage of propeller marks and torn welds are due to V-1 and V-2’s bow’s separating while their sterns collided. As the two vessels began to separate, the damage became lighter. 
Immediately following the collision, Operator1 (V-1) returned to V-2, however engine damage delayed his response and forced him to use his trolling motor for primary propulsion. During the return to V-2, another vessel arrived to assist. On the assisting vessel was an off-duty paramedic. Subject boarded V-2 and found V2 occupant (V-2 passenger) was face down on the deck of the vessel, unconscious. Operator2 (V-2 operator) had also been unconscious, but “came to” sooner than his passenger. Subject focused on rendering aid to V2 occupant as V-2 was pulled to the Harney Pond Canal boat ramp. V-1 followed V-2 as it was being towed. First responders were waiting on-scene at the boat ramp and began assessment of injuries upon the vessels arrival. Ultimately, V2 occupant was airlifted to Lawnwood Medical Center in Ft. Pierce and Operator2 was transported by ambulance to Raulerson Hospital in Okeechobee. After a brief stay at Raulerson Hospital, Operator2 was transported to Lawnood Medical Center. 

Based on evidence and information gathered to date, both operators are at fault in this accident. The collision was a result of both operators’ inattention while navigating a congested area with low light visibility. Both operators stated they did not see the other vessel leading up to the time of impact. If either vessel maintained a proper lookout a collision would have been averted. Speed also played a factor. The propeller marks on V-2’s starboard side are an indication V-1 reacted by turning to its starboard side, however, the high rate of speed diminished a safe “window of opportunity” to avoid collision. Lastly, evidence indicates a crossing situation at time of impact. Coast Guard navigation rules state V-2 should have given way to V-1. ; Operator2:During the interview he stated he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.; V2 occupant:During the interview he stated he had a spinal fusion

While fishing an occupant hooked an unknown object near the weir. The occupant continued to reel and the vessel was picked up in the current where it was brought closer to the weir. V1 hit the weir and began taking on water. V1 then capsized throwing three occupants into the water. All occupants made their way to shore. One occupant was injured from the prop of the motor. 

Once at the weir a fishing line got caught on an unknown object near the weir. Operator advised that they were outside of the orange boundary markers when this happened and the motor was in neutral. The occupant that was stuck continued to reel his line in and it brought the vessel across the boundary markers. The vessel got caught in the current and continued moving north towards the weir. Operator put the vessel in reverse right when the bow of the vessel hit the weir and began taking on water. 

At this point, Operator fell overboard while the vessel was in gear. He advised that he was able to grab on to the starboard side of the vessel, and he felt his jeans get caught in the prop. He advised that his left leg began getting struck by the prop. Operator then took off his jeans while still in the water causing the prop to get bound up, stalling the motor. Operator explained that the boat flipped over causing all the occupants to fall overboard. 

While all the occupants were in the water, Occupant1 was taken into the current near the weir where he was having trouble swimming. Operator was able to grab Occupant1 and lead him away from the weir. All of the occupants then made it to shore on the east bank of the canal. Operator advised that he saw his wounds for the first time and saw that he had been cut several times from the prop. 

Occupant1 and Occupant2 headed south down the bank to Stewart Blvd in order to get help. Operator said approximately 45 minutes went by until Occupant1 was able to flag down a vehicle on Stewart Blvd. The Good Samaritan, followed Occupant1 back to Operator’s location, where they helped bring Operator back down to Stewart Blvd to the Good Samaritan’s vehicle. Operator, Occupant1 and Occupant2 all entered the Good Samaritan’s vehicle and were brought to the hospital to have Operator’s injuries tended too. Operator advised that he was released from the hospital that evening after receiving stitches. 

Operator obtained several lacerations to the outer thigh and knee area of his left leg.

The Kootenai County Marine Unit and Drive Rescue and Recovery team were dispatched to the scene. Upon my arrival we had two surface swimmers at the vessel and two divers searching the area. 

I observed a Tan small 10 foot utility boat half submerged about 450 feet southwest of the east boat launch.  

I contacted (P) the passenger and asked him what happened and told me the following: he and his uncle (O) had planned a camping trip.  Operator had been camping and fishing Fernan Lake for many years.  The plan was to load the boat with camping supplies and transport them across the lake to a camping spot which is only accessible by boat. 

Occupant stated they arrived at the boat launch between 0100 and 0200 hrs., hoping to get the gear across the lake and set up camp and get in an early fishing trip.  Occupant said there was about three or four boat loads of equipment to transport across the lake. They loaded the boat and Occupant told Operator there was too much stuff in the boat and said they could do more loads.  Operator refused and told Occupant to bring the rest of the stuff from the truck to the dock.  Operator then left with the first load and shortly returned.

Once Operator returned they loaded the rest of the gear in the boat.  Occupant said the boat had so much stuff they had to sit on top of the gear instead of the seats.  Operator made Occupant put on his PFD before they left the launch, but Operator was not wearing one. 

As they left the launch and maneuvered through the lily pads the electric motor made a noise.  Operator made a statement about that not being good.  Occupant said that all of a sudden they were pushed into the water.  Occupant went over to Operator who was having a tough time swimming.  Operator asked Occupant to help remove his coat because it was getting heave.  Occupant attempted to keep Operator above water but was having a difficult time.  Occupant swam over to the boat to obtain a PFD for Operator, as Occupant turned around Operator had gone under the water. 

Occupant swam to the shore to get help.  Once on shore Occupant walked to the launch got into the truck and drove towards town until he was able to find someone to call 911.

I asked Occupant about the safety equipment in the vessel. Occupant stated there was four other PFD’s in the vessel, but did not have lights, a sound producing device and registration.  Occupant stated they used a battery operated lantern to see.  

The location of the boat was marked and towed to shore.  The vessel was a 10 foot aluminum utility punt row boat with a Minn Kota 35 watt electric motor.  There was no identifying marks on the vessel and no HIN located.  The vessel appeared to have been painted a few times.  I was unable to locate any holes in the hull of the vessel and there was no drain plug.  

The remaining gear in the boat was three vehicle batteries, a camp stove, a camp table, blue plastic tote full of food and other small camping gear.  The vessel was seized for additional investigation. 

I was able to locate the camp site across from the launch and observed a large cooler full of food about 10 fishing poles a few tackle boxes, a large multiple person tent, two large black garbage full of clothing, a few camp chairs, a vehicle battery and a few other items which is consistent with Occupant statement of overloading on the first trip.   

Based on Occupant’s statements and the evidence at the scene, I believe Operator and Occupant were in a small utility row boat that was overloaded. As they were crossing Fernan Lake the vessel swamped knocking both Occupant and Operator in to the water.  Occupant wearing his PFD was able to swim to the shore after attempting to assist Operator.  Operator not wearing a PFD and having heavy clothing was unable to swim to shore, did not stay with the vessel and eventually went under the water.

Search efforts proceeded for four days until the sonar team located Operator’s body and the dive team recovered him.

It should be noted that the sandal was pointing towards the back of the boat. Officers further observed a cell phone, leather wallet, and keys lying on the front left passenger seat. 

Officers did board the boat to perform a welfare check and located a Texas Driver's License inside of the leather wallet. Officers made a NCIC/TCIC check of subject and the boat, which returned clear. Officers searched the nearby water for Subject but were unable to locate him at this time. 

Subject's daughter was contacted by Grand Prairie police and said she would come to the scene. Subject’s daughter did arrive on scene and identified herself. Subject’s daughter told Officers that Subject was supposed to be at work around 2:00pm. Subject’s daughter had not heard from Subject today. Officers released the leather wallet and house keys to Subject’s daughter. At around 7:05pm., Officer arrived on location and  determined that his K9 was unable to start a track.

Upon investigation, Vessel  1 was headed in a North direction on a PWC.  Vessel 1 had two other passengers on board. 

Vessel 2 was also heading North with his sister riding in the middle and brother riding on the rear. 

Vessel 1 was riding approx. 50 yards directly behind vessel 2 and moving in the same direction.  When both PWCs went over a large wave in the ICW, Vessel 2 suddenly stalled out.  As vessel 1 went over the wave, both passengers fell off.  This caused Operator1 to panic and quickly accelerate directly into the stalled out vessel 2.   Operator1 stated that just before impact, she tried to steer away from the other PWC and screamed.  Vessel 1 turned slightly to the left just before impact.  Vessel 1 went up and over vessel 2 ripping off the steering column of vessel 2.  The impact threw all 3 passengers of vessel 2 off the starboard side of the vessel and into the water.  

All passengers of each vessel re-boarded their PWC and vessel 1 towed vessel 2 back to Sloop Point Access Area where a NC Marine Fisheries Officer reported the incident to NC Wildlife.  All three passengers of vessel 2 were taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center-North for treatment for lower leg injuries.

Two people called and reported someone moaning and yelling for help.  Caller1 located a person in the water near Rocky Point, SW of the Carbondale boat ramp, on the South Shore of Cedar Lake.  CPO''s located a submerged V bottom boat, near the powerline crossing on the main body of Cedar Lake. The boat was tied to the West rock wall (N37.65474, W089.28021). CPO1 went on shore to look at contents which appeared to have been thrown onto shore.  The boat lacked any visible registration on the bow portion sticking above water. CPO1 secured additional lines to the boat and a brief scan using the sonar was conducted.

At approximately 1 PM, They located Caller1, the witness from the Carbondale ramp. Caller1 used his boat to (IL9322HH) to rescue the person in the water around 8 am.  Subject1 told them operator was on shore near the boat.  

We located the boat and observed only the bow surfacing.  CPOII and Sgt secured a line, to the bow, and towed the boat towards the Carbondale boat launch.  The boat surfaced and the motor cowling was missing.  When we reached the shore the water inside the boat caused it to roll over.  We flipped the boat back over but observed the motor and trolling motor had come unattached.  

We retrieved the 2 motors and placed them in the boat.  We towed the boat onto the ramp and allowed it to drain.  I observed the plug inside the drain and water was still draining out of the boat.  The boat had been painted multiple times and no hull damage was observed.  The boat appeared to have paint transferred from the bow, where it impacted the rock wall, and a small dent on the plate the eyelet was mounted to.   We observed no HIN or registration numbers on the side.  

On 8/24/17 I spoke with Operator and Occupant on the phone.  They stated the following occurred.  On 8/21/2017, at approximately 1230, am Operator was operating a grey unnumbered 15 foot open aluminum motorboat on cedar Lake.  Subject1 occupant was a passenger riding towards the bow of the boat.  The boat was headed South and travelled under the powerlines.  Occupant heard Operator yell the boat was taking on water.  Operator was approximately 20 yards from the Shelter Bluff shore.  He attempted to run the boat onto shore, to prevent the boat from sinking.  The boat impacted a sheer rock wall and the stern of the boat sank into the 15 foot deep water .

The Operator had four other passengers on board with him at the time of the crash. All the occupants of the boat had been drinking prior to the accident and had visited a local bar in Woods Bay.

The Operator stated that he tried to go upstream the Swan River towards the Bridge Street bridge and ride the current down. The Operator further stated that he succeeded in one pass and since everyone had such a good time they tried to do it once more. On the second attempt to go upstream and ride the river current down the operator lost control of his vessel and ran into the dock at 338 Bridge street. 

The operator said that once he hit the dock he could not right the vessel and headed straight for the dock at 350 Bridge street where his vessel crashed and came to rest.

On 07/02/2017, at about 11:43 a.m., this vessel was cruising in Puget Sound/Elliott Bay near the Elliott Bay Marina located near Seattle, WA in King county.  

According to Law Enforcement, on this date and time, they received a call of a sailboat crash in Elliott Bay.  The call stated that a sailboat had crashed into the Elliott Bay Marina's breakwater, and that there was a person in the water.

Law Enforcement arrived at the scene.  Fire Department personnel, who were already at the location, had secured the vessel in a side tow configuration and was in the process of dewatering the boat.  Officers stated that the driver/owner, Operator1, had been pulled from the water by the Port of Seattle Police Marine Unit and transported to a Seattle Fire Department Medic Unit.  Operator1 was transported to the hospital where he was treated and released.  It was verified that there were no additional victims in the water.  

The sailboat sustained significant damage.  Dewatering the vessel continued to avoid sinking until it could be towed to a boatyard. 

Operator1 was contacted later via telephone.  He stated that he was motoring to the Elliott Bay Marina and was walking down the port side of his sailboat, preparing to dock.  As he was walking along the port side walkway, his hand slipped from the guide rail and he fell overboard.

On this date, I was detailed to The Maurice River in the area of Four Star Marina in Maurice River Township, Cumberland County for a reported overturned vessel.  Specifically, it was reported that a white Carolina Skiff was overturned and they were ejected.  

Dispatch next reported that a vessel traveling in the opposite direction was the cause and left the scene traveling toward the Delaware Bay. The vessel was described as a White approximately 23 foot vessel with a blue T-top. The vessel had two occupants, a dog and had the name Apollo II on the side.  

Upon arrival, I spoke with the operator on vessel #1.  Same stated he was traveling east towards Millville when he observed vessel #2 traveling in the opposite direction.  Operator #1 claims vessel #2 was traveling at a high rate of speed pushing a large wake.  Operator #1 stated he turned into the wake in an attempt to hit it straight on.  After hitting the wake of Vessel #2, Vessel #1 capsized and all three occupants were ejected.  Operator #1 stated he did not pay very close attention to Vessel #2 at this point because he was concerned with the safety of his children.  

I continued my investigation by checking all other marinas in the area.  I was able to locate a vessel matching the description provided by Operator #1. The vessel later identified as vessel #2 was tied up south east of the fuel docks at Long Reach Marina.  The vessel was a White 21 foot Mako with a blue T-top Bearing NJ Registration.   This vessel also had the name Apollo II on both sides.  I spoke with marina employees who stated the vessel left around noon and returned at approximately 1430.  This would put this vessel at the reported location at the time of this accident.  I was advised the owner’s son is the only one who uses the vessel and provided with a phone number for same.  

I contacted the operator #2.   I advised operator #2 of the situation and he calmly stated he did not believe this was him.  Operator #2 admitted he was in the area at the time this occurred, but stated he had no knowledge of any vessel capsizing anywhere around them.  He stated at no time was he operating carelessly and did not believe his actions or wake caused any vessel to capsize.  

As a result of this investigation it was determined that vessel #1 passed vessel #2 in opposite directions.  After passing each other vessel #1 turned into the wake of vessel #2 and capsized.  Both vessel #1 and vessel #2 were up on plane however, this was not a slow speed area for any reason.  Vessel #2 sustained no damage and may not have known vessel #1 capsized.    All though there was no impact the outboard engine on vessel #2 was submerged and is now inoperable. 

There were no injuries and no summonses were issued.  The operator of vessel #1 stated he does not wish to pursue the matter at this time but was advised I have 30 days to issue same.

The unknown jet ski traveled toward the State of Louisiana. 
Warden1 notified Newton County Texas Game Warden and Sabine Parrish Louisiana State Game Warden about the accident. Warden1 observed the damage on v1 jet ski and concluded that the unknown jet ski appeared to attempt a splash; therefore, the unknown jet ski struck Operator1' s jet ski at the front causing fiberglass damage along the right side of the jet ski. 
Operator1 advised she was just idling, waiting on her husband Witness to catch up and she noticed another jet ski heading towards her. Before she could react, the unknown jet ski collided knocking her off her jet ski, and the unknown jet ski proceeded toward the State of Louisiana.

Operator explained to me that they had launched their vessel to go fishing, despite the bad weather conditions. She further explained that as she was attempting to get the vessel up on plane, she did not notice how shallow the water was near the south west edge of the lake, and as a result the vessel hit ground and began taking on water over the port side of the vessel from the waves due to the sea conditions and the sudden stop of the vessel. 

The seas were approximately 3 foot at the time of the incident. The vessel sank on a sand bar that they struck with the skeg. At this time Operator began to panic and called 911. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the Lake Walk-In-Water boat ramp and boarded the vessel of another fisherman who then took the officers to the location of Operator and occupant. The officers were able to get both Operator and occupant off of their flooded vessel and onto the fisherman’s vessel without any injuries. At this point, they proceeded back to the boat ramp and shortly after FWC arrived on scene. The boat was not able to be recovered at the time due to the poor weather conditions.

He informed me that we were going to go to new bern, nc to investigate a possible boating incident.  Officer  and i patrolled to union point park in new bern where we met with sgt.  From union point park, we were able to observe a sailboat drifting underneath the hwy 17 bridge.  The sailboat was accompanied by a tow boat us vessel.  It appeared from our position that the mast of the sailboat was no longer intact.  The mast and the sails appeared to be resting on the vessel.  I observed the tow boat us vessel tow the sailboat to bridgeton marina.  

Officer drove our patrol vehicle to bridgeton marina to make contact with the vessel occupants.  We arrived at bridgeton marina at approximately 9:15 pm.  Upon arrival, Sgt, Officer, and i spoke with the operator of the sailboat.  

Operator reported he and his son left out of bridgeton harbor marina sometime after 3:00 p.m. to go sailing on the neuse river.  Operator reported there was a decent wind and his vessel reached the neuse river bridge area without incident.  He reported he had not planned to be out long so he and his son turned the vessel around to head back toward bridgeton marina.  Operator reported that they were near marker 32 near the drawbridge and the us 17 bridge.  While heading across the river back toward bridgeton, the vessel ran aground.  

The wind had started to pick up with greater intensity, preventing operator from getting his vessel off the bottom.  Operator reported he and his son proceeded to take down the main sail and when they tried to roll in the roller furling they were unsuccessful.  Operator reported that apparently the roller furling line had gotten tangled in some way such that it would not draw the headsail back into position.  Eventually an individual in a grady white motor boat came by and agreed to pull them off the bottom.  Operator reported when his vessel got pulled off the bottom, it was somewhere north of the us 17 bridge close to the boatworks in bridgeton.   

Operator reported he was unable to take down or put the headsail up.   He reported the wind would catch the headsail and then spin the vessel around.  Operator reported he and his son fought the wind and the current for as long as they could.  The wind finally pushed the vessel broadside.  Operator reported he could not control the vessel to move upriver.  Operator reported the wind was so strong that it pushed the vessel toward the us 17 bridge where the mast collided with the bridge.  The wind was pushing the vessel sideways under the bridge but the mast was keeping the vessel from going under the bridge.  Operator reported that eventually the mast bent and broke free from the bridge.   Operator reported he threw out an anchor south of the bridge and called tow boat us.  Tow boat us helped operator get the mast out of the water and then towed operator's vessel back to bridgeton marina where i met with him.  

I was able to photograph and observe where the mast of the sailboat appeared to break.  The damaged area appeared to be at the base of the mast.   I took several other photographs of the vessel.  Operator agreed to email a completed form mb4.1.   Operator was not charged with any violations.   Nothing further at this time.

     Once on scene, Warden started to identify everyone involved with the accident by calling in their information to Sabine County Dispatch. Warden had everyone write out a statement of the events that took place. 
     From gathering and interpreting the statements from the individuals, it appeared that Operator2 was traveling east on the South Housen boat lane while Operator1 was traveling south on cross over (Housen North to South) boat lane. Operator1 proceeded to turn on the Housen South lane traveling west while Operator2 was trying to turn on the cross over lane. 
Operator1 struck the port (left) side of Operator2's boat. Operator2's boat had extensive damaging to the port (left) side of the boat, and extensive fiberglass damage to the stern (back) side of boat.

The caller, (mother and spouse) said she did not know which boat ramp that they had launched at and only knew that they went to Lake Tawakoni.  Also at time of morning a thunderstorm with heavy rains and high winds had come across that part of the lake.  

While in route to the lake, I contact my co-worker Game Warden for assistance.  Since not knowing which part of the lake they could possibly be on, we began searching the boat ramps for Operator pickup which was described as a white ford 4x4 pickup.  When I arrived at the Caddo Creek boat ramp which is a public boat ramp about 3 miles from the residence, I found a truck with an empty boat trailer attached to it.  I then ran the LP through dispatch and confirmed that the truck belonged to Operator.  

Warden and I launched a patrol boat at the boat ramp and began searching the surface of the water and shoreline for any sign of where they might be located.  After searching the Caddo arm of the lake for 2 and half hours with no luck, we received a report about a chocolate lab dog that had been spotted on the south shoreline across from the Caddo Creek boat ramp which located on the north shoreline barking and running up and down the shoreline.  After hearing about this, we pointed the boat that way.  After driving through about 40yds of stumps and submerged timber in middle of the lake, we spotted a half of dozen mallard decoys tangled to some submerged timber floating of water's surface about 50yds off of the port side of the bow of our patrol boat.  As I began to turn the patrol boat toward the decoys, we spotted what appeared to be more equipment floating on the water about 25yds off the starboard side of the bow of our patrol boat.  I then turned the boat and we drove to it first.  When we got close to it, we then realized it wasn't equipment but instead it was Occupant deceased face down in the water sitting on top of a piece of submerged timber.  He was not wearing a PFD.  We placed him in our patrol boat.  His body's appearance was as if he had been in the water for several hours.  Then we took him to the boat ramp and secured him on shore and called the justice of the peace.  

Deputy with the Hunt County Sheriffs Office stayed with body of Occupant on the shore while Warden and myself went back out to continue searching for Operator.  After searching for another hour and due to the dangerous nature of navigating through the submerged timber, we marked off the area and called off the search until the next morning.  At about 10:00am the next morning, we located with our side sonar on our patrol boat what appeared to be an image of a body on the lake bottom about 15ft from where we found Occupant.  At about 10:30am with the use of a snatch hook and rope, we pulled Operator to the surface.  He was found deceased and not wearing a PFD.  

We also located the boat capsized floating on the surface of the water about 200yds from where we found the bodies.  The boat was a 14ft flatbottom with 9.9hp outboard mounted on the stern and a foot controlled trolling motor mounted on the bow.  We also identified that the drain plug had not been inserted the boat.  When we brought the boat to the boat ramp, it was identified as the boat that the victim used.  We also were never able to locate any PFDs for the boat.

According to the medical examiner, the cause of death for both victims was accidental drowning. Also no alcohol or drugs found to be in use as the time of the accident. 

The factors for the cause of this accident were operator inexperience (less than ten hours), inclement weather to include heavy rain and strong winds, a failure to affix the drain plug to the boat, and not having PFDs in the boat.

Upon my arrival, I found Operator2 hunched over the seat of Vessel 2. Operator2 was bleeding from his mouth and lacerations to his nose and chin. Operator2 also complained of pain when moving his jaw. Operator2 was brought onto my patrol boat and I rendered emergency medical care to him. I asked Operator2 what happened and he said Operator1 had run into him. Operator2 is Operator1''s Boyfriend.

Vessel 1 was left with Operator1 to operate. Dep arrived and towed Vessel 2 to Dock 2 where it was released to Operator1.

I transported Operator2 to the Saguaro Lake Aid station and continued to render care to him. I turned over care of Operator2 to AMR210 and he was transported to Banner Desert Hospital for further treatment. 

I spoke with Operator1 who said Operator2 was teaching her how to splash with the PWC. She said she tried to turn as she got close to the Vessel 2, but it just took off and hit Vessel 2. I confirmed with Operator1 that she was trying to splash Operator2 and she said she was.

Vessel 1 sustained scratches on the front port side hull. Vessel 2 sustained damage to the starboard side mirror, which was cracked and scratched.

I was advised that the two subjects were out of the water and the rescue personnel were performing CPR on a child.

     I responded and arrived on scene at 20:05 hrs.  The child had already been transported by ambulance to Inland Hospital in Waterville.  I asked the other victim and mother of the child, Operator 1, to sit in my vehicle while I attempted to ascertain what happened.  Operator 1 told me that at some point upstream they went over the dam and the canoe they were in capsized and both her and her son, Victim 1, were thrown into the river.  They floated downstream for a couple hundred yards and both subjects were wearing personal flotation devices.  Operator 1 stated that she found her son (Victim 1) “stuck in some branches” in the river, face down in the water and removed him and brought him up on shore.  Operator 1 stated that her son was vomiting at this time.

Operator 1 stated that she did not have custody of her child at this time as DHHS was involved.  She identified her case agent.  At this time I asked Trooper if they could locate agent and relay to her what was going on. 

     I asked Operator 1 if she had any family members we should contact and she stated no.  She advised me that her father was deceased and her mother was out of state.  She stated that a mutual friend of her and her mothers' resided locally and I should contact her.  

     I asked Operator 1 if she was hurt and if she needed any medical attention.  She lifted her shirt over her left hip slightly and showed me a slight abrasion and stated she was very cold and couldn't feel her feet.  At this time I summoned rescue personnel to the scene.  After a short time, neither rescue personnel nor delta Ambulance had responded, so I transported operator to Inland Hospital.  

    I was met at the hospital and DHHS case worker and briefed them of the status.  I spoke to the nurse on duty and the attending physician.  They advised me that they were currently performing CPR on Victim 1 and attempting to slowly raise his core body temperature.  They advised me they would continue for another hour or so.

   I returned after a period of time to check back with ER personnel and they advised me that Victim1 had a femoral pulse and they would be transporting him by LifeFlight to EMMC in Bangor.  I cleared the hospital a short time later.

     On 05/16/17 at approximately 7:00 am I contacted the ICU at EMMC to learn of Victim 1's status.  The charge nurse advised me that Victim 1 was deceased.  At approximately 9:00 am I returned to the scene for further investigation.  T

here were two dams upstream of the scene from the night before.  The furthest dam up was functional and the lower dam was dilapidated.  A yellow canoe was lodged just over the first dam.  Subject claimed to be the owner of the canoe and other canoes he provided for local users.  There were also life jackets available for individuals as well.  After photographing the canoe, Subject and others removed it from the face of the dam.  At this time I retrieved the serial number off the canoe and left the scene.",17W005774,44.48,-69.62,C

The incident occurred near marker five in ramsey creek.  Ramsey creek is located in mecklenburg county.  There were two vessels involved in this incident.  The first vessel is an 11 foot 2015 sea doo personal water craft.  This vessel is equipped with a 300 hp engine.  The second vessel is unknown.  The incident resulted from Operator1' personal water craft striking vessel number two's wake.  Operator1 injured her right leg in this incident. 

Operator1 was operating a personal water craft in ramsey creek.  Operator1 was accompanied by another personal water craft whose father owned both vessels.  Operator1 decided to jump a wake.  Operator1 struck the wake with the bow of her vessel.  Operator1 hit the wake at an approximate speed of 25mph.  Operator1 stated that she struck the wake with too much speed.  While jumping the wake, she was thrown airborne from her vessel.  On her descent, Operator1' right leg struck the personal water craft.  The strike resulted in a laceration on the front of her right leg.  The laceration is located below the knee.  While in the water she yelled for help.  Two witnesses in a black ski boat stopped to render assistance.  They pulled Operator1 into their vessel and called 911.  Operator1 was transported by cornelius fireboat to kings port marina.  She was transported by ambulance to the main campus of carolinas medical center.  Operator1 was treated for the injury on her leg and released.   The vessel was not damaged.  Operator1 was wearing a type iii pfd.

In conclusion, it is apparent that operator inexperience is the primary cause of this incident.   Operator1 did not know how to properly operate the personal water craft over the wake.  Operator1 does not have boating safety education as required by law.  There were no other injuries, and no vessels were damaged as a result of this incident.

It was determined that two individuals were present aboard the vessel when it capsized and both individuals were unharmed in the incident. The vessel was not recovered from the location where it sank. See detailed narrative for further.  

Neither subject aboard the vessel prior to the vessel sinking sustained any injuries relating to the event. Operator told me that he was operating the vessel, which was described to me as a 12 foot homemade vessel, downriver with the current on a bend in the river. While traveling with the current and experiencing reduced steerage of the vessel, the vessel's bow encountered and became stuck on top of a partially submerged tree in the river. 

The stern of the vessel was then pushed by the strong current against the submerged tree. The current then began pushing on the vessel against the beam of the small vessel. The force of the current pushed water over the gunwale of the vessel and the vessel sank. 

Both Operator and Occupant were evaluated by EMS and were unharmed by the incident. Occupant's vessel was not recovered from the river and due to several factors including the remoteness of the location, depth of the water, presence of numerous submerged objects, and the swiftness of the current recovery of the vessel would be impractical. On 4/28/17 I spoke toOccupant on the phone and Occupant advised me that several individuals had attempted to locate and remove the vessel on several occasions but at this time are still unable to locate the vessel. This concludes all action taken by myself regarding this incident at this time.

I advised I would investigate. 

 I arrived to the area of Lookout Point at 1030 hours and observed a vessel with the top 5 feet of the bow sticking out of the water.  I went to my patrol boat to investigate further.  I arrived by boat at the scene at 1100 hours and observed a cabin cruiser boat had sunk in about 10 feet of water.  The KA numbers were visible on the side and were KA106XC.  About 5 feet of the bow of the vessel was above the water and the vessel was standing upright.  

I called the registrant’s number with no answer and left a voicemail.  A few minutes later my call was returned.  I advised Owner who I was and asked if he knew where his boat was.  Owner advised it was at El Dorado and it had sunk on him the previous night.  I asked if anybody was injured and Owner advised me he was alone and not hurt. 

 I asked Owner why it wasn''t reported to anyone this happened and Owner advised he didn''t ""know what the protocol was"".  Owner stated he had called his insurance and was waiting to hear from them on what to do next.  I advised Owner to return to the lake and meet with me.  Owner arrived at the reservoir at 1320 hours and met with me.  I again went over the details with Owner.  I asked Owner the events leading to the boat sinking.  

Owner advised he was on the North side of Bluestem point and slowly driving the vessel when he felt an impact under the boat.  Owner advised it didn''t seem like anything had happened.  Owner then stated he anchored and swam around for about 2 hours.  Owner then stated when he got ready to leave he noticed there was a lot of water in the boat.  Owner stated every time he gave the boat power the water went towards the back and killed the engine.  Owner said he was trying to limp the boat back to the boat ramp where his trailer was and it sunk on him at the point we found it.  

Owner stated when it went down he went to shore and was picked up by a passerby.  I asked Owner if the boat had any history of taking on water and Owner stated it has always had some water that came in the boat.  I advised Owner we wouldn''t be able to get the boat out of the water for him due to the size of the vessel.  Owner stated he would get somebody to get it out.  On July 30, 2017 at 1845 hours I was notified by Heartland towing that they had the vessel and were close to getting it to shore to pull it out.  I advised I would meet them there.  When the vessel came out of the water, I noticed 2 areas where water was coming out of the boat.  The areas were  the bilge area at the front of the vessel where the water should come out and the other was where the I/O connected to the vessel.  

Looking at where the motor connected, I could see where there had been caulking done several times.  I noted the drain plug was inserted into the vessel.  On July 31, 2017 at 1130 hours I met with Heartland towing where the vessel was being stored.  I took pictures of the stress fractures on the back of the vessel.  It is unknown whether these cracks occurred from impact or from the boat being drug to shore.  We investigated further the area where I saw water coming out the vessel.  We notice a red cable connecting to the motor which came out of the vessel through a 3/4 inch hole.  The was nothing stopping water from going into the hole.  We also checked the vessel for safety equipment and found it all on board.  After leaving, I met with the owner of Shady Creek Sales and asked him about the cable.  I was told the cable was a shift cable.  State determined that the sinking was either due to the impact causing the caulking seal to break or the hole where the shift cable allowed water ot enter.",20170440-023,NA,NA,NA

Both operators were instructed to park in the particular spot below the buoy for the hydro boat time trials, in front of Riverside Park and Hellgate boat docks.  Both boats were beached on the river bank, but not tied to anything.  About half an hour later one of the scenic trip boat drivers came down river and passed.  There was no abnormal wake produced.  Around 10AM they saw the first lunch trip boat, Vessel 3, headed down their way.  The operator of Vessel 3 came on the right side of the time trial buoy, closer to the two beached boats.  In actuality Vessel 3 was supposed to go on the left side of the buoy.  

As Vessel 3 approached the vicinity directly across from Vessels 1 and 2, he hammered the throttle and sent a ""plow"" amongst the water.  This produced a wave over four feet tall.  Vessels 1 and 2 were pitched 180 degrees.  One person in Vessel 1 was standing on the back deck hanging onto the tower and the wake pitched her completely out of the boat.  The operator of Vessel 1 was also pitched overboard.  The operator of Vessel 2 and his daughter were thrown down and fell hard within their boat.  The operator of Vessel 2 suffered an injury to his right knee, causing it to swell and required a doctor's care.  

There were a total of 6 boats on the lunch trip and every boat following Vessel 3 took the path on the left side of the buoy and produced minimal wake.  The operator of Vessel 1 immediately contacted the marine deputy who had placed them at their location and reported the incident.

The initial response we received back from the operator of Vessel 3 was that he completed our form, in essence, stating that there was no damage or injuries on his boat and no damage beyond $2,000 or injury beyond first aid to any other boats involved.  After almost 4 months he finally sent a mostly complete report.  

He stated that he has been driving a commercial jet boat for 15 years.  He is a senior jet boat pilot employed by Hellgate Jet Boat Excursions in Grants Pass, Oregon.  On the date of the incident he was conducting his daily tour from Grants Pass to OK Corral, as he has been doing each day and sometimes 3 trips per day over the same rapids all season.  On this day the water level was high.  In all the years and approximately 3000 trips he has navigated he said he has NEVER seen any boat parked on the SANDY BEACH where the two boats were parked.  He had NO option or choice but possibly cause a WAKE by staying on plane.  This rapid (Switzer Rapid) is ONLY safely navigated on PLANE carrying speed by their commercial boats hauling 55 passengers safely.  His number one concern at all times is the safety of all his passengers and fellow boaters.  He added that as of 09/13/2017 he has never been given any information or photos, and has no knowledge of any damage that occurred the day of the incident, to any of the boats that were involved (parked on the Sandy Beach), either from the marine deputy or any other parties involved.  His observation that day was when he saw the boats that were on the Sandy Beach, they looked secured.

Allegedly, another Hellgate driver told the operator of Vessel 1 that on the private radio between drivers the operator of Vessel 3 said to ""run the other boats on through, they get what they deserve for parking there.""  Vessel 1's operator was also told that another Hellgate driver asked the operator of Vessel 3 why he did that to Vessels 1 and 2, as there was no need to do that.  Vessel 3's operator allegedly stated ""it's early to set precedence on where they can park their boats.""

One of the vessel owners reported the call to the Austin Police Lake Unit marina office via telephone.  The owner/operator said a PWC had just impacted his boat by the Pennybacker Bridge.  The physical location of the bridge is 5200 Capital of Texas Highway, Austin, Texas.  

Myself and SPO responded to the call in our marked police boat.  We arrived at the scene just a few minutes later and located the vessels about 100 yards down river of the Pennybacker Bridge.  The PWC was still attached to the front of an Axis boat operated by the complainant, Operator2. 

The owner/operators were asked if anyone needed emergency services to get checked out but all declined.  We managed to untangle the PWC from the other vessel and towed it to the docks by the Pennybacker Bridge with its occupants on our boat.  No sooner had we pulled up to the dock than the PWC started to take water to the point of having the PWC partially submerged.  The damage to the PWC was at the bow and slightly below, indicating that it was probably traveling at a slower speed where the bow stays elevated until it reaches cruising speed or ""planes"" out.  

The Axis, operated by Operator2, had a very visible indention in the bow due to the crash but was in no way taking on water as the crash damage was pretty high.  Operator2 had several people in his boat and said he was at idle taking in a tube that was being used to tow some of the occupants who had rented his boat and getting ready to go home.  He said he heard the PWC coming up river but thought that the operator had seen him.  Operator2 said he expected the operator to turn or stop but never did and he impacted Operator2's vessel, knocking over the passenger of the PWC in the water.

The operator of the PWC, Operator1, related the same series of events.  He said that upon impact, the passenger fell into the water, but quickly retrieved her back onto the PWC.  Operator1 said he was doing approximately 15 to 20 miles per hour and no faster.  The damage to the vessels indicate a low speed crash and the lack of injuries partially substantiates the speed estimate.  Both were wearing a personal flotation device at the time of the accident.  Operator1 attributes the crash to the fact that as he was operating the PWC, he and occupant had their heads turned looking at the homes on the lake and not paying attention to what was in front of them.

Operator2 told me that he had childcare issues he had to deal with and had to leave but left me all of his information and his passengers information.  Operator1 stayed due to the PWC being incapacitated due to the crash.  I suggested to him that due to the crash, it would be in his best interest to have the PWC towed to the nearest repair facility.  He agreed and Bullet Towing showed up to take the PWC.  As the tow truck started to be en route, I provided a courtesy transport a few miles up river while Operator1 stayed with the PWC.  After the PWC was picked up, Operator1 was also provided a courtesy transport to his home up the lake.  He was also cited for Reckless Operation-PWC.

The vessel  was resting on its port side, on the bottom, and the wind had it partially lodged underneath the floating dock. The tide was outgoing. Shortly after my arrival, Sea Tow representatives showed up to aid in righting the vessel and were ultimately successful in raising it.

The dispatcher advised a subject ran a PWC onto the land and had a head injury.  RFC and I responded to the incident scene via a truck.  We were unable to locate the residence but later determined it was the Georgia Power Park and not a residence.  When we arrived on scene we noted the victim had been transported to Athens Regional Medical Center for treatment.  We asked people in a nearby pavilion if they had witnessed the incident.  No one in the pavilion would come forward and make a statement.  We were told by EMS personnel that the PWC was put back into the water and was driven off from the scene.  We searched the park but we were not able to find the PWC in the park.  RFC and I took measurements and noted evidence we had.  

	RFC noted and measured where the PWC and the victim landed on the shore.  We also noted where the PWC struck the bank.  It was determined Vessel A struck the rocks on the shoreline, ejected the operator, hit on the shore approximately 45 feet from the water, skipped and hit a concrete picnic table approximately 70 feet from the water.  The PWC came to rest when it struck the concrete picnic table.  The operator was thrown approximately 40 feet from the water onto the land.  The operator was transported by EMS personnel.  Alcohol was believed to be a factor in the incident, see incident report number l100109450.  The vessel involved in the incident was not located.  

	Operator was released from Athens Regional Medical Center in the early morning hours of 070217.  RFC talked with Operator and had him blow on the PBT after smelling an odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his person.  The PBT showed a positive result and a search warrant was taken for the blood samples taken by Athens Regional Medical Center.  Charges are pending based on the BAC level of the samples we took into evidence and tested by the GBI.

	The Lab results were obtained and Operator's BAC was a 0.099, which is over the per se limit of 0.08.  I obtained warrants for Boating Under the Influence, and operating a PWC greater than idle speed within 100 foot of a shoreline.

I pulled up Google Earth and showed him a view of Lake Pleasant, Operator pointed to the area known as the Auga Fria Arm north of the Eagle Clouser.

He estimated approximately $2000.00 in damage and he was not filing a claim with his insurance company because he has a high deductable.

Witness #3 and #4 stated to the effect:  We were on the back deck facing towards the back of the boat, cleaning the fish.  We saw both of them near the cockpit, then felt the crash.

Operator #1 stated to the effect:  We were coming down the canal, when I asked someone to take control of the helm so I could step away.  By the time I turned around, I realized that no one was behind the helm and we crashed.

Investigation revealed:  Vessel #1 was traveling south in the Point Pleasant Canal, Point Pleasant Boro, in the vicinity of Canal Point Marina.  Due to operator inattention, along with a strong south current, Vessel #1 lost directional control, and struck the bulkhead of the marina along the edge of the canal.  While under power, there was confusion between the operator and an occupant on the vessel.  

Both individuals believed that at the moments leading up to the collision, the other had control of the helm.  Vessel #1 then struck the wood lattice fence on top of the bulkhead, with its bow railing.  Vessel #1 then struck the lower part of the bulkhead with the port bow lower hull, followed by impact with the port stern.  Operator #1 regained directional control of the vessel, and continued south down the canal and returned to Arnold's Yacht Basin.  Damage was observed to the bow railing, with scrapes and gouges to the port bow lower hull.  A gouge was observed to the port stern below the gunwale, and splintered fiberglass to the stern.  At the marina, a fifteen foot section of wood fencing was damaged.  Point Pleasant Boro Police Department assisted.  No injuries reported.

At about 16:30, operator was driving the vessel up the bay river in a westerly direction.  The sun was directly in front of him and low to the horizon.  The glare from the sun was making it difficult for operator to see the water in front of the vessel, and he then struck red navigational marker ""10"" on the starboard side of the vessel's bow.  This marker is located just upriver from chapel creek.  The vessel was on plane and traveling approximately 30 mph at the time of the collision. 

No one was injured from this incident.  The collision resulted in extensive fiberglass damage to the starboard bow and gunwhales and an estimated $20,000.00 worth of damage.

operator took his family fishing on August 12, 2017 at Choke Canyon Reservoir. While on the lake Operator used a rope to tie off to a tree. The rope extended from the cleat on the starboard side of the stern to the tree at an unknown length. The wind (approximately 10mph) and waves (approximately 6""-12"") applied tension to the stern of the vessel where the rope was connected and forced it to sit lower in the water than normal. 
At this point waves striking the stern would have would have come over the top of the vessel allowing water to enter into it. Over an unknown amount of time the stern of the vessel would have sank lower due to the weight of the accumulating water and allowed more water to enter from the waves. At a certain point Operator and his family noticed water entering the vessel at a high rate and it began to sink. Operator moved quickly to the stern of the vessel with a knife cutting the rope and freeing it from the tree. After the tension from the rope was released the weight from the amount of water on board and the movement of the occupants caused the boat to capsize. The PFD's for the vessel were stored under the driver's console and were not able to be recovered or used after the vessel capsized. 
All four occupants on board exited the vessel while it was capsizing. After the vessel capsized and settled all four occupants climbed back onto the vessel. While the vessel was capsizing, Subject1 was sitting near and open tackle box. During the motion of the vessel capsizing Subject1 came into contact with two bass lures, one puncturing her left forearm and one puncturing her first two toes on her right foot. When we arrived on scene my partner, Texas Game Warden and I placed all four occupants onto our patrol vessel. I administered first aid to Subject1 and we transported the family to the Calliham Unit of Choke Canyon State Park where EMS was on standby. EMS informed me that Subject1's injuries were minor but they would need to transport her to the hospital in Jourdanton to have the fishing hooks removed. We took witness statements from operator and his two daughters  (the other occupants on board the vessel). They were released from the scene. 

Upon inspection of the vessel I witnessed the plug was in place and secure and there was no damage to the hull which could have allowed water to enter.

DNR communications confirmed that the victim was a 44 year old female, and that she was being transported to Easton Memorial Hospital
 
I arrived at Easton Memorial at approximately 2008 hours and met with hospital staff who advised the victim was in extreme pain, and bleeding from the vaginal area. They further advised that they are unsure of her condition, and that I could make contact with her after she had gotten a CT scan. Ambulance staff said they believe the victim was withholding information, and wouldn’t give any details as to whose jet ski she was on.
 
 I spoke with the victim, who advised she was on the back of a friend/coworkers pwc, and suddenly “flew off” the back of it and got injured. She said they went out on the ski at approximately 1215 hours in the area of St. Michaels, but was unfamiliar with the area, and couldn’t advise the body of water. 

Victim stated that she had been wearing a lifejacket, and that he had some experience with jet skis-as she had been on one several times last summer. She said she believed they were going full throttle when she fell off the back of the ski, but doesn’t remember her friend making any evasive moves or turns-she just remembers falling off and flipping “end-over-end” in the water. I asked Victim if there had been any other boats around them, and she said there was a small fishing boat-who eventually pulled her from the water, as her injuries prohibited her from getting back on to the pwc. 

 I asked Victim if she had been drinking prior to the incident, and she admitted that she had. In the course of interviewing Victim she advised she did not want to reveal the name of the coworker/friend who had been operating the pwc because she didn’t want them to get into any trouble. I asked why she thought this person would get in trouble and she wouldn’t answer. I again asked her what her coworker’s name was and she provided a name. Victim said she lost all her belongings when she flipped in the water-to include her house keys, and other personal items. I asked her who called 911, and she said it was her daughter. I asked Victim as to the extent of her injuries, and she said she was bleeding from her vaginal area-despite not having a period in 10 years, and she was also feeling extreme pain in her leg, back, and tailbone areas.

GSP Dispatch told me that Hall County dispatch had called and relayed that a boat was spotted half sunk with no occupants seen in or around the boat. I responded by truck and while enroot I made contact with the Hall County Fire Boat ""marine 1"". Marine 1 was able to give me the registration number for the sunk vessel and I looked up the registered owner. The boat registration returned back to a 1991 Caravelle Classic. 

I called subject who told me that two men named Operator1 and Operator2 had been driving around the lake that afternoon with his boat, Subject also told me that Operator1 was driving his boat while Operator2 was driving a jet-ski. He told me he knew the boat had sank and that Operator2 was returning to the boat to retrieve a cell phone he had stored in the boat. I asked Subject if he knew where Operator1 could be found and he told me he was staying a Shady Grove Campground. I called Cpl. and RFC (who were also responding to the incident) to make their way by boat to the crash site and to talk to Operator2 and get a witness statement from him (see Supplemental reports). When I arrived at my boat in Aqualand I drove to Shady Grove Campground. 

When I arrived I was assisted by the park officer who drove me to the campground that Operator1 was staying. When we pulled up to the campsite I met Operator1 Operator1 who told me he was the driver of the Caravelle boat and that Operator2 had jumped a wake and landed on the back of the boat which caused the boat to sink. 

I also noticed a smell of alcohol coming from Operator1. Operator1 admitted to drinking and I asked him to accompany me back to my boat (see OPERATOR1 BUI report). I took Operator1 back to the crash site after arresting him and turned him over to Cpl.. I was informed that Operator2 who was driving a 2016 Yamaha Jet ski had been drinking and I began to investigate him for BUI as well.

	In conclusion On April 1st 2017 at approximately 1600, Operator1 was operating a 1991 Caravelle herby known as vessel 1 while intoxicated out of sunset cove when operator2 who was driving a 2016 Yamaha jet-ski herby known as vessel 2 and also intoxicated, illegally jumped a wake close to vessel 1. The force of the jump was strong enough to caused vessel 2 to land on the starboard side of the stern of vessel 1. With the added weight of vessel 2 to vessel 1, buoyancy was lost and water was able to come over the gunwales and fill the hull of vessel 1 causing it to sink. Due to air-pockets in the bow, vessel 1 was not a total loss and was able to remain near the surface. Tow Boat U.S.A. was able to salvage vessel 1 later that evening.  END OF REPORT

Maryland State Police said they received the call from Garrett Regional Medical Center. I arrived at Garrett Regional Medical Center at approximately 5:45pm. After arriving, I was able to speak to the operator of the personal water craft. 

Operator said he was operating a friend’s personal water craft, a green 3 person Seadoo, while his son age 13 and nephew age 13, where waiting to go for a ride on the dock. Operator wanted to splash his son and nephew on the dock and approached them at speed. Operator lost control and hit the dock causing the personal water craft to go over the dock hitting both his son and nephew. The watercraft struck son in the chest pushing him out of its path.  The nephew tried to get out of the way by climbing on a docked boat. The watercraft struck his right leg. All parties were wearing life jackets. The incident occurred at approximately 3:00pm. Son sustained minor injuries including a contusion on his chest and some pulled muscles in his hip. Nephew sustained a fracture to his lower right leg.

On 07/09/2017, at about 07:17 p.m., these three vessels were on Lake Washington near the Madison Street Dock located near Seattle, WA in King county.  

According to the Operator of V1, on this date and time, his vessel was cruising at the above location.  He had just come over a large wake.  His boat hit hard throwing him to the floor of the boat.  The boat turned sharp right and collided with 2 other boats (V2 & V3) before he could shut it down.  

Law Enforcement reported that on this date and time they were dispatched to a boating accident at the above location.  Upon arrival, officers met with all parties involved.  Operator2 told officers that he was next to his friend, Operator3.  Their two boats were not moving and were essentially adrift.  Operator2 said that he was checking on Operator3 to see if he needed assistance.  

Operator2 went on to say that after about 5 minutes of conversation with Operator3, V1 struck his vessel (V2) on the port side and then struck Operator3's vessel (V3) on its port side.  Operator2 and his passenger were transported to the Madison Street Dock where they were treated by Seattle Fire Department.  Both sustained cuts to their head and neck area.  Operator2 returned to his vessel shortly after.  V2 occupant was transported to the hospital by AMR.  Operator3 and Operator2 towed V2 to the Atlantic Street Boat Launch.

Officers then spoke to the Operator of V1.  He stated he was north and west bound in the lake headed toward the Highway 520 Bridge.  He said he was crossing behind a large boat and struck its wake causing him to lose control of his boat as he exited the wake.  Not in control, he struck V2 and V3 which were on the opposite side of the large boat.  

Operator said he did not see the other boats while he was not of control of his vessel.  He remained in the area after the collision.  There were no injuries involved on his boat (V1). Officers spoke to a witness who confirmed Operator's account of the incident.  Witness was not sure how fast V1 was traveling.

*NOTE:  All V2, V3 and Witness information was taken from the BAIR completed by Law Enforcement.  No BAR for either vessel was submitted.

On 8/19/2017 I, CPO received a voicemail on my state cell phone from subject.  Subject stated that his vessel a 1988 20 FT Bass Buggy (Vessel 2) was docked within the Kankakee Valley Park District Marina at slip number 10. Subject stated that on 8/12/17 he was preparing his boat for recreational use and observed damage (a large dent and scrapes on the starboard stern of his watercraft pictures attached).  Subject observed that the watercraft docked in the slip next to him had sustained minor damage to the port bow.  Subject contacted the registered owner of a 2007 21FT Sunset Ray (Vessel 1) the neighboring watercraft.

On 8/12/17 Subject spoke with Operator1 on the phone and she admitted that when she was entering her slip on 8/11/17 the port bow of her watercraft had collided with the starboard stern of his watercraft.  At the time of incident she was unaware that any damage had been done to Subjects watercraft.  Operator1 agreed to exchange information and generate a police report.

On 8/19/2017 I, CPO responded to the Kankakee Valley Park District Marina to conduct a watercraft accident investigation.  I met with Subject and assessed the damage to his boat vessel 2 (photos attached).  I also assessed the minor damage to Operator1s boat (vessel 1).  I contacted Operator1 by telephone and was not able to reach her.  I traveled to Operator1s residence and met with her. Operator1 agreed to meet me at her slip within the Park District Harbor.  At approximately 2:30 P.M. I met with Subject and Operator1 to discuss the incident.  

After arriving at the Marina Operator1 began to second guess herself and question whether or not her boat actually caused the damage to Subjects boat. Operator1 agreed that we should recreate the alleged accident.  We pulled her watercraft out of the slip and lined the port bow of her watercraft up with the starboard stern of Subjects watercraft.  The damage to the port bow of her boat matched up exactly with the damage to the aluminum starboard stern on Subjects boat. After aligning the boats Operator1 took full responsibility for the damage caused to Subjects watercraft.  Subject and Operator1 exchanged insurance information.  I obtained written statements from both subjects (Attached).  Both subjects were given instructions and a copy of the Boat Accident Operator Report Form.  Operator1 purchased her watercraft in May of 2017.  Operator inexperience with her new watercraft was a contributing factor to the accident.

Later that day, at 3:47 pm, i called operator and he told me a quick summary of what had occurred.  I asked him if we could meet the following day in person to discuss the incident.  

Upon walking in operator's residence, i observed that many of his belonging were in boxes around the apartment.  He reported that he was in the process of moving out of state.  I asked operator to tell me what had happened regarding his vessel.  Operator reported that on 6/15/17, he launched his vessel, which he described as a 35' fountain, from the oyster creek boating access area near davis, nc.  He pointed out to me on google maps where he launched from.  He reported he then rode his vessel around in the sound for a short period of time before driving it out to the ocean.  

He reported he went through drum (ophelia) inlet and then went south.  He reported he eventually turned around and came back north towards the inlet.  He reported he was going approximately 70 or 80 miles per hour when the engine started acting funny and he noticed smoke coming from the starboard (right) side engine compartment.  He reported at this time he was approximately ½ or ¾ of mile from shore in the ocean.  He reported he was approximately four to six miles south of drum inlet.  He reported after seeing the smoke, he stopped his vessel and opened up the starboard side engine compartment door.  He reported he only saw smoke, no flames. 

He reported after about a minute, the vessel's automatic fire extinguisher was activated.  He reported he also activated his handheld fire extinguisher in an effort to extinguish the smoke.  He reported that despite his efforts to extinguish the smoke, the smoke continued.  He reported he then jumped off of his vessel into the water.  He reported he was wearing an inflatable pfd and it inflated when he went in the water.  He reported he then swam to the core banks.  He told me, “it took a long time.”  He reported while he was in the water, he looked back and did not see his vessel anymore.  

Operator reported by the time he made it to the core banks, it was almost dark.  Operator reported that he then walked across the banks and then swam and walked through the core sound back to the main land.  He reported he walked through marsh grass to get back to highway 70.  Operator reported that upon reaching highway 70, he walked north for about an hour until he arrived back at the access area where his vehicle was parked.  He reported he arrived back to his vehicle at about 3 or 4 am on 6/16/17. 

 Operator reported his cell phone did not get wet because he left it in his vehicle, along with his wallet.  I asked operator if he had washed his clothes since the incident.  He reported he had not.  I then asked to see the clothes he was wearing when the incident occurred.  He walked around his apartment for a couple of minutes looking for them and then reported to me that he must have washed them.  He reported he was wearing a khaki shorts and a t-shirt.  I asked operator where his pfd was. 

 He told me that he threw it away in the dumpster at his apartment complex.  Operator also reported that he was barefoot when the incident happened.  I found it unusual that he did not report his feet were cut up by oyster shells.  Operator was unable to tell me the registration numbers of his vessel.  

Operator reported that his boat trailer was in swansboro in a fenced in storage area.  After leaving operator's residence, sgt. and i patrolled to swansboro and were able to locate a boat trailer that was registered to operator.  I later contacted operator's insurance company, progressive, and they were able to provide me with operator's boat numbers.  Operator was not charged with any violations.  Nothing further at this time.

I opened the vents and windows in the state room in an attempt to clear it. A crackling sound was coming from the starboard rear transom area. I then unplugged the shore power. Smoke was now coming from the cabin. I grabbed a fire extinguisher lifted the access panel but could not locate the source of the fire. I then ran to my neighbors to call 911. When I returned back to my boat I smashed the kitchen cabinet off the wall in the stateroom in order to gain access to the panel. When I opened up the access panel flames poured out and I could not extinguish them. I then assisted my neighbor remove their boat from harms way. Ten minutes later my boat and the adjacent boat were fully engulfed.

Witness # 2 stated: I saw the fire and called 911.

Investigation Revealed: V1 and V2 were both moored at Hudson Point Marina on C-Dock facing a northerly direction. V1 was docked at slip C-6 and V2 was docked adjacent to V1 in slip C-4. Both vessels were plugged into shore power. The occupant of V1 attempted to turn on the heat utilizing the reverse cycle air conditioning consequently an electrical malfunction ignited a fire in the stateroom. V1 became fully engulfed, the fire eventually spread to V2. As a result V1 and V2 burned down to the waterline ultimately sinking in their slips. V2 suffered extensive fire damage. Subject refused further medical attention other than an EMT checking for smoke inhalation. Custom Marine out of Dobbs Ferry, NY has been contracted for salvage operation.

I asked Operator how fast the boat was traveling he stated he was on plane and was going around 35-40mph. Based on the distance traveled after the initial impact the evidence indicates the  boat had to be on plane.  I asked Operator if he noticed the two flashing buoys he had driven between that marked the island and no boat zone that he drove into. He stated he did not see them at the time he drove through them. 

At the time I was on the scene and when I left both buoys were flashing and located outside of the point marking the danger areas. I asked Operator how much he had to drink prior to driving he stated he had drank two beers.  I then asked Operator if there was anyone else on the boat, he stated no. I went and looked in the boat to make sure there wasn't anyone left on the boat. The boat was unoccupied the door to the cuddy was open and there were two beer cans in plain view lying on the floor. The carpet inside the boat was wet and smelled of alcoholic beverage. 

At this time I examined the damage to the boat inside and out. There were multiple stress fractures to the cuddy door and trim around the door from the impact. It pushed some of the wood used to brace the backseat out into the floor. The boat was measured to have travelled 120 feet on the shoreline out of the water. The terrain consisting of rocks and sand tore the hull and outdrives on the motor up to the point of leaving the boat inoperable. While walking around the boat to look at the damage it was discovered that roughly 25 feet from the boat was a cooler with beer that matched the manufacturing numbering of the beer from the boat as well as a box containing 2 bags of marijuana, as well as several small smoked marijuana joints. 

The box also contained paraphernalia consistent to marijuana use. There were footprints in the sand leading from the boat to where the cooler and box was located. I asked Operator if the box and cooler sitting beside the boat was his or his passengers and he stated it was not. He stated that it could be anyone's and implied there were people that showed up as soon as the boat ran ashore and it could be theirs. The two adults camping had their children with them and were roughly 200-300 yards from where the boat ran ashore.  I spoke with two witnesses that were camping on the shoreline that saw the boat run onto the shore. They both stated they could see the boat coming from the water, and they came around the point and were headed straight for the shore and never changed directions. They also stated once they ran ashore Operator who was driving seem uninjured and was out walking around. They stated Victim seemed to be in pain and discomfort and laid down almost immediately after getting out of the boat. Victim was transported from the scene by Wayne County EMS. Wayne County EMS transported Victim to Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital where he was treated and later released that night. 
After speaking to everyone involved it was evident that impairment was a factor in the boat running ashore. Also speed, inexperience of the terrain in the area, and not having a proper lookout contributed to the grounding. 
Operator was arrested and his Miranda rights were read. He was then transported to Wayne County ER for a blood draw. Operator was read the implied consent form at which time he refused to submit to a blood sample. Operator was transported to Wayne County Detention Center upon leaving the hospital. While traveling to and from the above listed locations Operator seemed lethargic and confused of the situation that had happened. He spoke about his trip down that weekend and a series of events that had happened that didn’t pertain to what was going on the night of the accident. Operator needed to have everything explained multiple times when traveling to and from the hospital and jail after he had been told what was occurring.",1117-18245,NA,NA,NA

At approximately 1746 a personal watercraft (PWC) approached the patrol boat and the operator notified the officers that there was a PWC accident just west of where they were located on the river.  

Officer1 operated the patrol boat to the area where the operator pointed and observed several individuals in the water and a woman holding a young male that was crying in her arms on a PWC.  

Officer1 took the young male from the woman and put him on the floor in the bow of the patrol boat.  Officer1 noted that he had a very swollen, bruised and protruding area just above his left eye.  Officer1 immediately called in to AGFD dispatch and notified them that medical services were needed.  

Officer took a young female aboard the patrol boat who was crying and laying on her side.  Another young man was swimming in the water and Officer1 instructed him to board the patrol boat using the swim platform. An individual aboard a private boat in the area told Officer1 that he was an EMT and asked if she would like his help and Officer1 had him swim to the patrol boat and board using the swim platform.

Officer and the EMT tended to the injured children as she operated the patrol boat to the intersection of Riverfront Rd and Trane Rd.  Officer1 requested that AGFD dispatch send emergency services to the location.  As two ambulances arrived at the location, a private boat came to the scene and an adult male was asking where the children were going to being taken.  Officer1 identified the male as the father of the two children.  Officer1 had Father swim to the patrol boat where emergency service professionals were assessing the two children.

Officer1 questioned SUBJECT1 if he had any injuries and he stated that he did not.  She then asked him what happened and he stated that they were going up river and Father was ahead of him with the two children on his PWC. He stated that he was operating the PWC that he was on to the left of Father''s PWC.  SUBJECT1 stated that Father slowed down and turned to the left and that he was going too fast to avoid them and ran over the top of Father''s PWC at full speed.

After the ambulances left for Western Arizona Regional Medical Center with the two children, Officer1 took Father and SUBJECT1 back to the location of the accident and found Father''s PWC on a beach.  Another member of the party then showed up on SUBJECT1''s PWC.  Officer1 took photos of both PWC''s involved in the accident.  Officer1 took Father and SUBJECT1 back to Community Park beach to join the rest of their party and Officer had both Father and SUBJECT1 complete voluntary statement forms.  Officers found the statements made by Father and SUBJECT1 to be consistent with the damage to both PWC''s.

Officers followed up on the condition of the children at Western Arizona Regional Medical Center and learned that Subject2 was going to be flown to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas due to his head injury.

Operator2 stated that he was hit by a unoccupied personal watercraft (PWC) being towed in by a motor boat with VA registration 1269 AX at approximately 1915 hrs.  Operator2 stated that the PWC struck him in the right shoulder after being pushed by the wake of the motorboat that was towing it.   

Officer interviewed the victim at his residence two days later and she provided the following statement: “On 6/5/17 I interviewed Operator2 at his residence. Operator2 was involved in a boat incident near Dutch Gap Landing in Chesterfield, VA on 6/3/17. Operator2 went to the Portsmouth Naval Medical Center the morning of 6/4/17 and received care beyond first aid. Operator2 stated that he was fishing from his anchored kayak across from Dutch Gap Landing on 6/3/17. He had a personal flotation device (PFD) on board but was not wearing it. He was anchored parallel to the shore approximately 15 feet from the shore and in approximately 40 feet of water. At approximately 1920, a black deep V-hull vessel approximately 16-18 feet in length approached him towing a personal watercraft (PWC) off its starboard side. Operator2 stated there was 6 people on board and estimates the operator was in his mid-30s, with blonde or brown hair, approximately 225-250 pounds, and was shirtless. Operator2 estimated that the tow line was approximately 8 feet long. Operator2 stated that the vessel was coming towards him with the “bow up” and pushing a lot of wake. Operator2 started waving and yelling at the vessel to make them aware of his location. When the vessel was approximately 10 feet away it turned slightly to its port side and was 4-5 feet away from Operator2 as it passed. The in-tow PWC swung to the right and struck Operator2 on his starboard side. Operator2 stated that he could hear the occupants in the vessel laughing as they drove away. 

The vessel went to Dutch Gap Landing, loaded the PWC onto a trailer, and the occupants got back on the vessel and left. Operator2 stated that he heard them laughing again as they passed him again after leaving the landing. The PWC left scratches and a small dent on the starboard side of the kayak and struck Operator2 on his right upper body. The kayak was swamped with water, but did not overturn. 

Operator2 was able to retrieve his anchor, maneuver back to Dutch Gap, and was able to load his kayak with assistance from others. He then notified Chesterfield Police who informed to contact Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries about the incident, which he did. He stayed at Dutch Gap Landing until approximately 2030-2100 and eventually spoke on the phone with Sergeant about the incident.  

On the morning of 6/4/17, Operator2 went to the Portsmouth Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Virginia to be medically cleared to resume his current naval duties. Operator2 had 8 X-rays taken of his right collarbone, right chest, and right upper arm. He was diagnosed with deep tissue bruising to the right side of his sternum, right side of his rib cage, right collarbone, and right upper arm. He was prescribed the pain medication, Flexonal, for pain management. Operator2 is currently not medically cleared to resume his normal duties and is on modified status. He has a follow up appointment at Portsmouth Naval Medical Center on 6/12/17.” I took photographs to document the damage to Operator2’s kayak. I noted a small dent in the middle of the starboard side about halfway down the length of the kayak. I also noted several fresh scratches extending several feet from the area of the dent towards the bow of the kayak.  Operator2 provided a written statement to the events of the incident. He typed the statement as he was unable to write at this time. He also provided a diagram drawing depicting where he was anchored, the direction the other vessel was heading, and his surroundings. 

On 6/8/2017, I spoke to the registered owner of the motorboat.  Operator1 said that he was towing a broken down PWC from the gravel pit back to Dutch Gap boat landing.  He said there was a lot of boat traffic around the Dutch Gap landing and he was focused on staying away from that traffic.  Operator1 said he did not see the Operator2 in the kayak until he got very close, at which time he turned to avoid him.  Operator1 said that the disabled PWC was on a short (approx. 8 ft tow line) and as he turned it went off of his boat’s wake and came very close to Operator2 and his kayak.  

Operator1 said he estimated it was about 5 feet from the kayak but definitely did not hit the kayak or Operator2.  Operator1 said if the PWC had hit him it would have knocked Operator2 out of the kayak.  Operator1 said that he felt bad for throwing a wake on Operator2 and yelled out to apologize.  Operator2 said that the owners of the PWC were on his boat but he did not know their names.  He said that his wife and his friends were also passengers on his boat.  Operator1 provide me with contact information for those passengers. 

I spoke to subject1 on 06/09/2017.  She confirmed that Operator1’s boat was towing in a distressed PWC and that due to oncoming boat traffic near Dutch Gap, they passed the kayak with little clearance, but there was no collision.  She estimated that the towed PWC came within the width of a car of Operator2, or about 5-6 feet.   

I spoke to her husband on 6/23/17.  His account of the events matched his wife’s and Operator1’s.  He said that Operator1 had to avoid a boat coming down river while they were traveling upriver near Dutch Gap and the towed PWC came within 3-4 feet of Operator2 and his kayak but there was no collision and Operator2 was only splashed.     

 Operator2 insists that he was indeed hit by the PWC and forwarded me his medical correspondence from his doctor’s visit. 

 It is my opinion that that Operator2 was hit by the towed PWC, and that Operator1 and the passengers of the motorboat did not think there was a collision, partly because Operator2 did not fall out of the kayak and because of their viewing angle.  I discussed the case with an assistant Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney who recommended a reckless operation of a motorboat charge.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Operator had the goal of canoeing down stream on the Missouri River and to arrive near the Leavenworth, Leavenworth County, Kansas boat ramp sometime Monday, 04/03/2017. 

On the canoe, Operator had packed a tent, some camping equipment, several lanterns and head lamps, a yellow in color Type III PFD, which he was sitting on, and his cell phone. Somewhere near River Mile Marker 435, Operator was attempting to tie his canoe off onto the shore. Operator realized he left his tie rope at home. The weather on 04/01/2017 at 21:00 hours was cloudy, rainy and in the mid-to-low 40''s. It was also dark outside due to the time of day as the sun had set several hours prior. Operator remembers the canoe tipping to the Port Side and capsizing. 

Operator did not have his life jacket on and was unable to grab it prior to capsizing the canoe. Operator stated to me that he possibly had leaned too far to one side of the canoe, causing it to take on water on the Port Side and immediately flipping over onto the port side. When Operator came back up above the water, he attempted to board the up-side-down canoe twice. After being unsuccessful, Operator gave up and began to swim to shore. Operator stated he had over 100 hours of experience on canoes and kayaks, ranging back to his time as a young child. 

Operator made it to shore without injury, but lost all of his equipment and the canoe he was operating. The canoe Operator lost was owned by someone else. At the time of the incident, Operator was drifting and not actively paddling. Upon reaching shore, Operator climbed a very steep bank by using tree roots to support his feet. Upon getting to shore, Operator observed a light in the distance and could hear dogs barking. This was the only residence Operator could see, so Operator headed that way. Operator stated to me he remembered the house was a nice house with a two-car garage and three cameras on the outside of the home. Operator made contact with the homeowner, who gave him an extra set of clothes to change into. Operator did not know where he was, or the homeowners house. I used the timeline Operator gave me to establish where I believe Operator to have had his boating accident. I have no definite proof this was exactly where it occurred. Operator could not remember any other details other than those mentioned. Operator arrived back home after receiving a ride from another landowner in the area around 12:30 hours on 04/02/2017. Operator contacted me on 04/02/2017 at 08:11 hours to notify me of the accident. I interviewed Operator on 04/02/2017 at his residence. This interview was recorded on my body worn camera.

I have no further information to report at this time.

When i arrived on scene, the female victim, was being treated by paramedics with the monticello fire department.  She was laying on her stomach across the back of the boat.  It appeared that she had suffered a large laceration to her lower back.  I spoke to the victims husband, briefly as he was very shook up and worried about his wife.  I was able to gain his name, dob and the name and dob of the victim from him.  I then spoke to the operator of the boat. 

 Operator was hard of hearing and did not have his hearing aids in so it was difficult to talk to him at this particular time.  He stated that he had taken his hearing aids out and they were still in the boat.  I advised him that once the medics were done in the boat, he could get his hearing aids and we would continue our conversation.  I then assisted with transporting the victim from the boat to the cot so she could be transported to the hospital by ambulance.  The paramedics advised me that they had already requested a helicopter to meet them at the hospital and that the victim would most likely be flown to an indianapolis hospital for treatment of her injuries.

     i then went back to the boat where operator had been able to put his hearing aids in.  I asked him to explain to me what had happened that morning.  Operator stated that he was boating with his family, his daughter, the victim, her husband and their two daughters, operator's grand daughters.  He stated that they had anchored the boat so that everyone could get into the water and swim.  At this time, everyone was in the water except for operator and one granddaughter, they were still in the boat.  He advised that the anchor was not holding well and the boat was drifting towards the shoreline.  Operator advised that he was just going to slowly back the boat away from shore.  He advised that he told the rest of the family members to get onto a ski tube that he had attached to the boat.  Operator advised that he looked back and saw everyone was on the tube so he started to back the boat away from the shoreline.  

He advised that he felt a large thud while backing the boat up and thought that maybe he had wrapped the rope for the tube into his prop.  He advised that he turned around and realized that he had struck his daughter in the back with the prop of the boat.  They were able to get victim back up into the boat, along with the rest of the family.  They tried contacting 911 for assistance but their cell phone kept dropping the call.  He advised that is when they drove up to the address on to get help.  I asked operator if he had been consuming any alcohol and he stated that he had not.  He consented to a pbt which showed a bac reading of 0.00. 

     operator advised that he had launched his boat from lake shafer boat rental and marina.  I told him that i would meet him at that location and assist him with getting his boat loaded back onto the trailer.  The owner of the marina helped us get the boat loaded.  I advised operator that his daughter was probably no longer at iu white memorial hospital but that i would have him follow me there to confirm exactly where his daughter had been flown for treatment.  We arrived at the hospital and we were advised that victim had been flown to iu methodist hospital in indianapolis.

     on july 9th, i was able to speak with both victim and husband via phone.  They were still at the hospital in indianapolis when i spoke to them.  They were able to confirm the events that operator had also explained to me on the day of the incident.  Victim did state that she was on the tube prior to operator backing the boat up.  She was not sure if it was a wave or what exactly caused her to fall off of the tube as operator was backing up.  She then stated that she was struck in the back by the prop and pulled underwater for a few seconds.  She was then assisted into the boat and was taken to the address on sullivan court.

Westfield blvd. Where the white river bypass goes over a low head dam into william's creek in indianapolis at approximately 8:20 am on saturday july 8, 2017.  The witness to the accident called in to report that the boat was caught on the dam above williams creek and that the victim was able to swim out of the water and was on shore.  

I called witness at the number i was given.  Witness advised he was driving the victim who was also the boat operator and owner to st. Vincent hospital in indianapolis for cuts which would require stitches and to be examined in the emergency room for any other injuries.  I thanked him for calling in the initial information and advised him i would go to the location to take photographs and then meet them at the hospital.  I then contacted marion county emergency communications dispatch (meca) to advise of the incident and if they received additional calls about the still visible boat from the adjacent road from passers by that there were no victims in the water.

	i arrived on scene later that morning and took electronic photographs of operator's pontoon boat which was still hung onto the top of the dam while the rest of the boat was in the boil below the dam.  I assured several onlookers that the boat owner, operator was safe and that he was at the hospital obtaining stitches but would be fine per a subsequent phone call update on his status by witness.  I also asked those present to spread the word through the close knit community that operator was alright and to stay away from the accident scene because it was not safe.

	i arrived at st vincent hospital shortly after noon and waited for operator to be discharged.  Operator's injuries were cuts sustained on his right hand pinky and ring fingers which required multiple stitches and stitches to a laceration to his head which occurred when operator was being recirculated in the boil of the dam.

	according to operator, he was attempting to remove his boat from his dock where large debris floats down the river to minimize damage potential to his boat.  Operator advised that he went out about 8:00 am, started his boat motor and then was removing his mooring ropes.  Operator stated that he removed the rear rope with the boat facing upstream without issue.  However, while attempting to remove the forward rope from his dock, operator was jostled when the current took hold of the boat and was immediately thrown into the water.  Operator was swept downstream past his boat.  Operator tried to swim back to the boat but was unable to make it due to the strong current.

	operator was quickly swept over the dam and was recirculated at what he estimated was five or six times.  Operator was sent downstream when the hydraulic was broken by either his boat or by large tree debris and was able to make it to shore about seventy five yards downstream just prior to the westfield blvd bridge.  Operator was not wearing a life jacket but did have at least fifteen on board the boat.  From initial observations from the bridge on westfield blvd, the boat will be a total loss as it has went over the dam with the rising water in the river and is being recirculated in the boil upside down at the time of this report. The boat and motor with accessories is insured through state farm agent for $ 20,000.00.  No violations or citations were noted or issued.

My daughter exited the tube and then took the rope from me. I went through the rear deck door to get her a towel and my son went onto the rear deck to get onto the tube.

While they were talking a moment he inadvertently stepped back into the well of the motor mount. I believe his life preserver largely cushioned his backwards fall onto the rear deck space between the ladder and the motor. However, as I went to help his sister pick him up he was complaining his ankle hurt. 

We placed him on the rear seat and upon checking his ankle I discovered the pain was actually from a laceration on the side/bottom of his foot. I told everyone on-board we had to return to the dock immediately and I had my wife call Bridge Marina to inform them we were returning to the dock with an injury.

I made contact with the owner/operator of the vessel and he advised me that he was the only one on the vessel at the time of incident. The vessel was a 2000 40' Mabry (Mattews closed cabin diesel cruiser. The vessel ""Outrageous"" was documented through United States Coast Guard with a hail port out of Secretary, MD Dorchester County. The only noticeable damage was to the engine and the engine room, which were both destroyed due to the fire. Subject1 advised me he was not injured during the incident and refused medical treatment.
  
  Subject1 told me he sailed from Warwick River (off of the Choptank River) and was heading to Ferry Point Marina for a scheduled maintenance appointment for his vessel. He was traveling around 16 knots (1800 RPM) passing the Malkus Bridge ( Route 50 Bridge) on the Choptank River and he noticed the vessel was overheating. The vessel low oil alarm sounded and the engine RPM dropped from 1800 to 900. Subject1 recalled that he made sure everything was functioning properly before he left his boat slip that morning. He called Ferry Point Marina and said he would try to ""limp"" his way there, but have a vessel ready to tow him in, if needed. He shut all of his electronics off and the motor suddenly stop working about 1/2 nautical mile from Ferry Point Marina. Then, he noticed white smoke coming from the engine room vent holes. Ferry Point Marina personnel towed his vessel in and tied his boat to the sea wall at the marina and Trappe Fire and Rescue put out the fire. One of the firefighters believed that the engine coolant system failed and caused the engine to stop working and the owner thought this may have been the issue as well.

She stated that the kayak belonged to the man that was living on the boat upriver from them.  The employee saw what looked like splashing near the kayak, that he thought was a person trying to swim.  There were other items that looked like luggage.

Gresham Fire boat 75 arrived with three rescue swimmers and went to the anchored boat.  There was a note taped on the back door that gave a name and phone number in case of emergency.   Other rescue personnel arrived and shoreline and on-water searches were started.  They found a rolled and tied up sleeping bag and the duffel bag packed with clothing, they also located the kayak against a wing dam.  An underwater camera was used, but nothing was found in the area.

The emergency contact on the note was called and she advised was the new owner of the boat, and the victim was the previous owner and he was staying on the boat until she got it paid off.  She said he texted her around 12:15 and said he was almost done with the boat and was going to head to shore.  He also told her he would need a ride to the bus terminal later to catch a bus to Arkansas to see his girlfriend.  She waited for him to contact her, but nothing further was sent.

On May 24th, 2017 at approximately 1245 hours, I Officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commision (FWC) responded to a boating incident involving multiple vessels at Harbor Town Marina in Merritt Island, Florida. There were three USCG documented vessels involved. When the incident occurred V-2 and V-3 were securely docked in their slips. V-1 was attempting to undock and pull out of the marina. The operator of V-1 lost control of the vessel causing the bow of V-1 to strike the bow of V-2. After striking V-2 the operator of V-1 attempted to take corrective actions in order to prevent another collision. The operator of V-1’s attempt to take corrective actions was unsuccessful and the bow of V-1 then struck the stern of V-3. The operator of V-1 then left the marina in order to prevent any further damage.

Victim was lying face down in the water, 47 inches from the edge of the water, at approximate global positioning coordinates (GPS) 31 degrees 39 minutes 04.32 seconds North latitude, -81 degrees 46 minutes 33.52 seconds West longitude. The water depth at this location was approximately 2 feet. 

There are uncertain circumstances surrounding the events of the incident.  We did not observe any obvious signs of trauma. Victim was wearing a red in color short sleeve shirt, denim jean shorts with a black belt around the waist, white socks and a pair of black with white trim shoes without laces. CSS noted the zipper on Victim’s denim shorts was unzipped. Victim had a silver in color watch on his left wrist and a gold in color ring on his right ring finger. A black in color nylon gun holster was attached to his belt on the right side of Victim’s waist. There was no weapon located in the holster. 

Victim had tattoos on his right upper arm, right forearm, left upper arm, left forearm and right lower leg.  Victim had a small cut on his left forearm. I observed a large scar extending from the top of the sternum distally along the midline of Victim’s thorax to the bottom of the ribcage. This scar indicates Victim had a cardiac procedure called a median sternotomy. CSS removed items from Victim’s shorts pockets and maintained inventory. A black in color leather wallet was removed from right rear pocket. The wallet contained Victim’s Driver’s License, a stent implant card along with assorted photographs and papers. A set of keys, two one dollar bills and two five dollar bills totaling twelve dollars were removed from Victim’s right front pocket. Victim’s left front pocket contained another set of keys, a SCCY® brand magazine containing four unfired 9 millimeter cartridges and a small brown in color glass bottle with a white in color screw on top. The vial contained small white in color pills believed to be sublingual nitroglycerin medication. Victim’s body was placed in a human remains pouch and transported by vessel back to the boat landing. Victim’s body was released to Coroner Parker at approximately 1210 hours. 

Coroner Parker later transferred Victim's body to GBI Department of Forensic Services for autopsy by Medical Examiner Dr..  Officers left to interview vessel owner and operator. 

Two men were on a boat to tie bush-lines.  One stood up to urinate off the side.  The boat began to pitch and the other man tried to grab the victim, which caused the boat to pitch even further and capsize.  One swam to shore from the middle of the lake and the other got on top of the overturned vessel.  At some point, he must have fallen off the vessel.  

Both subjects had been drinking.  The victim had a .117and traces of cocaine, meth, cocathylene and benzoylecgonine.  The survivor had traces of tetrahydrocannabinol and meth.  At the time of testing, his alcohol results were negative.
Although there were two life jackets on the boat, neither was wearing one.  Both struggled in the water.
It is the investigator’s conclusion that the victim suffered a cardiac event exacerbated by illegal drug use and stress caused by the boating incident.",A007010,31.58,-81.68,NC

Dispatch advised us that is was an airboat with two subjects on board that had rolled it over and that one of the subjects’ had been transported to the Hendry Regional Medical Center.

We arrived at the Hendry Regional Medical Center at approximately 2030 hours and made contact with the occupants of the vessel who was returning from a CAT scan. I observed him to have a laceration to his head above his eye and shoulder from being ejected and hitting rocks. He advised that his son was operating the airboat and would be arriving shortly. 

Once Operator arrived at the hospital, he advised us that they and some friends had been at Observation Island cleaning up the camp. Operator advised me they left the island and traveled south down a trail for approximately 300 yards. Operator advised as they was traveling in the trail, they struck a submerged rock on the left side of the airboat which caused it to spin out of control. Operator advised that upon hitting the rock, he and victim were ejected out of the vessel. Operator advised that upon begin ejected out of the vessel, he swam to victim and was able to get him onto the deck of the boat. Victim sustained a laceration to the right shoulder and a laceration to the right side of the head above his eye.

Rfc was able to maneuver his vessel and assist them into getting into his vessel. All subjects were extremely tired, cold, wet and covered in mud. Rfc was able to assess the subjects health. All subjects said that they were extremely cold with minor scratches from the oyster shells.

I asked operator to give me a synopsis of the events surrounding the boating accident. He advised me that at approximately 0930pm on 10/26/17, he along with his finance and 2 children came out of Mayport Inlet in Jacksonville and headed south with a destination of New Smyrna Beach. 

He advised that he had just purchased the sailboat a week prior in Jacksonville. He was operating his sailboat around the one mile mark. Approximately a quarter mile North of the location of the initial grounding, he saw a shrimp boat heading North trawling. 

The shrimp boat was altering its course to the East. In response, he altered his course to the West to avoid getting in the way of the shrimp boat. He altered his course too far West causing him to hit a sandbar approximately 400 yards off the beach. 

As the waves broke over the sandbar, he was able to inch his sailboat off and move South. However, the waves continued to push him closer and closer to the shoreline. When he was approximately 100 yards from the shoreline, he realized that he and his family may need help and he called Mayday over the VHF radio. When he realized his transmission over the VHF was unsuccessful, he called 911. 

St Augustine Fire Station 9 who happened to be directly across the street from Operator's location responded. They walked out along a sandbar to the location of Operator's grounded vessel. They directed him along with his occupants to get off the boat and took them back to shore. Operator did not have time to throw an anchor out. He along with his occupants were taken back to Fire Station 9. After going home, he returned to the location of his vessel later in the day to come up with a plan to remove the vessel.

We traveled to the location and found a white male, seated on the swim deck of a boat that was moored to the gas dock at the marina.  Victim had his left leg elevated. I observed a serious cut to his left leg in the area of the shin / calf.  EMS personnel arrived shortly thereafter and Victim was examined.  Victim made a statement to the EMT, ""I'm kinda drunk"" when asked about his level of pain.  Victim was placed on a stretcher and transported off of the gas dock and up to an awaiting ambulance.

Warden interviewed Operator, who was found to be the boat owner and the operator at the time of the accident.  Operator stated that he had pulled up to the marina dock to drop off two passengers who were going to get the vehicle and trailer so the boat could be taken off the lake.  After the two passengers got off the boat and onto the dock, Operator began to back away from the dock.  It was at this time Victim exited the boat off the back swim deck to relieve himself.  Operator stated he was unaware that Victim was exiting the boat.  

Victim was struck in the left leg by the boat prop.  After being injured, Victim was retrieved from the water and placed on the swim deck of the boat.  A 911 call was placed and emergency personnel were requested for assistance.  Victim made additional comments to Warden about his alcohol consumption.  Victim stated that he had consumed approximately 1/3 bottle of vodka and about 3 to 4 beers.  Victim also stated that that he brought his own alcoholic beverages to consume on the boat.  As part of the investigation, I examined a large amount of alcohol in the passenger area of the boat.  Other passengers indicated some of the observed alcoholic beverages belonged to victim which included a bottle of vodka and a stainless steel bottle that smelled heavily of an alcoholic beverage mixed drink.  The Operator voluntarily provided a breath sample into a PBT.  Operator's breath sample resulted in a .000 reading.

Game Wardens also responded to the location and assisted in gathering information.

During the investigation it was found that Operator was displaying the wrong number on the bow of his boat.  The error was explained.  Operator stated that he understood and he agreed to correct the error before using his boat again.  Operator was issued a warning citation.  

Additionally, due to Victim's age, 19 years old, and his apparent alcoholic beverage consumption found in the investigation, Victim was issued a citation for minor in consumption of alcohol.  I contacted Victim on the afternoon of May 5, 2017, by cell phone to check on his injury and to inform him of the citation being filed and that his copy was being mailed to his home.  Victim stated that he was doing well and that his injury required 9 stitches.  When informed of the pending citation, Victim became agitated and made disparaging comments about me as an officer and the work that I do.

Upon investigation it was found that the 20 hp motor on the 1974 Lund died due to machinery failure.  

The boat then drifted very quickly downstream due to the high water conditions on the Des Moines river at the time of the incident. The vessel quickly made contact with a construction barrier placed in the river directly below the NW 66th Avenue bridge. Due to the flow of the river, the vessel capsized as water started to flow very rapidly over the bow of the boat. 

The Operator, was able to quickly get out of the boat and stand on top of the metal construction barrier.  The boat capsized due to the high water flow of the Des Moines river, boat motor problems, and a metal construction barrier placed in the river by construction crews for the purpose of fixing the NW 66TH ave bridge.

 Operator2 provided me with his identification and USCG documentation number 1041078 for ""Time in a Bottle (Vessel 2)."" I asked him to give a synopsis of the events surrounding the boating accident. He advised that shortly after 0700am, he untied his boat lines and was leaving his dock slip to exit Camachee Cove Marina. Upon leaving his dock slip, the current pushed his bow into the bow of the sailboat directly East of his dock slip (Vessel 1). 

The anchor on his bow made contact with the bow of Vessel 1. He advised he attempted to back out after collision was made. However in the process, his anchor on his bow made contact with starboard side of Vessel 1 causing a second collision. 

Operator2 advised that he did not have any damage to his vessel as only his anchor made contact with Vessel 1. I did not observe any damage to Vessel 2. Upon damage assessment sustained to Vessel 1, I observed damage to one of the stanchions for the bow rail on the starboard side bow of Vessel 1. The pin was popped out of place and the hole where the pin was originally was partially bent. This would explain why the bow rail was loose. 

From my experience, damage sustained in this manner would require the bow rail to be replaced. I also observed a scratch and partial fiberglass gouge mark approximately 6 feet in length on the midship starboard side of Vessel 1. I documented damage sustained to Vessel 1 with photographs.

All occupants got back onto V1 when finished and V1 started to makes its way back towards the Tuttle Creek Marina.  

While in route, occupants of V1 started to hear the engine making some unusual noises and the engine eventually just shut off.  Occupants looked back and then realized that the back of the boat was almost to the water line.  Occupants immediately started to bail water and signal for help.  Another vessel in the area was able to come and assist and the 2 children from V1 were placed on to the helping vessel while the adults tried to bail water out of the boat.  An operator of a jet ski made his way over and was able to hook up to V1.  The jet ski tried towing V1 to the marina but was unsuccessful in its efforts and the boat took on too much water and sank in approximately 6 ft of water approximately 20 feet from the shoreline.  The bow portion of the vessel remained out of the water with the stern resting on the bottom of the lake.  Occupants were able to come aboard the KDWPT vessel and all belongings floating in the water we able to be retrieved.  No occupants of V1 sustained any injuries in the event.

Operator was navigating a turn to the port side when the vessel began to slide.  At some point in the slide, the vessel chine gripped the water which caused the vessel to turn hard to the port side.

The pontoon boat was following the houseboat out toward the no wake zone.  The house boat changed from reverse to forward direction.  The vessels were heading straight at each other at this point.  The vessels were in a narrow area between “A” dock and the shore.  

The occupants of the houseboat yelled to the pontoon boat that they are now heading forward into the marina.  The pontoon boat tried to get out of the way by backing up, but was not moving fast enough to avoid collision.  The pontoon boat then went in forward motion and tried to cut the vessel hard right, but when this happened the houseboat''s front port corner made contact to pontoon''s port side.

Operator1 stated he smelled smoke and lifted the engine compartment door. After Operator1 observed flames in the engine compartment he closed the door and heard the fire suppression system turn on. 

Operator1 then flagged down a passing pontoon boat that gave him a fire extinguisher. When Operator1 reopened the engine compartment door to use the fire extinguisher the fire grew out of control. Operator1 then left his vessel and boarded the pontoon boat. No statement could be taken from the pontoon operator due to the vessel leaving the scene before I arrived. The vessel was towed to Little Stoney Creek Cove, were the fire was extinguished by the Butler Fire Department. Shortly after the fire was extinguished the vessel sank. The cause of the fire was reviewed by a fire investigator for the Carter County Sheriff''s Office. The investigator concluded due to the vast amount of damage and the vessel sinking he was unable to discover the cause of the fire.

The caller stated that the trolling motor on the vessel was in the water and there were fishing rods and a cooler on the boat. 
    
The caller was able to relay the vessel registration number which enabled us to identify the owner.  Officer1 attempted to call the phone number listed on the vessel registration and did not get an answer.  Officer2 went to operator's residence and found no one at home.  Officer2 was able to make contact with a neighbor who reported seeing operator on thursday, july 20, 2017 and seeing his boat trailer hooked up like he was preparing to go to the lake.

Contact was then established with the pastor of the church operator attended, who informed investigators that operator had no living relatives.

Also on deck was a cooler which contained several ice packs that were no longer frozen.
     
At that time rockingham county first responders were notified in order to begin a search for operator as the incident began to gain public attention.  Investigators received numerous calls from individuals claiming to have seen the vessel in the same location on friday, july 21, 2017.  One individual reported having noticed the vessel on thursday, july 20, 2017 at approximately 7:00 pm with no one on board.  No one reported having witnessed an operator on the vessel or having actually witnessed operator entering the water.  Therefore, no one was available to fill out a 4.1 report form.
     
Several search and rescue groups began searching for operator with the aid of helicopters, k-9s, sonar, drag equipment and divers.  On july 28, 2017 at approximately 4:00 pm, the body of operator was recovered floating in the water nearby where the boat was originally found.

He explained that the winchester pd responded to a call about a vessel burning at the bass club dock located on tims ford lake. He was able to provide the winchester pd responding officers name. 

On 5-14-2017 between 1130-12 midnight i spoke to win. Pd ptl. about the incident which occurred earlier that day of the 14th. Ptl. stated that the 911 call came in 0n 05-14-2017 around 13:50 hrs. When ptl arrived on scene, around 14:00 hrs, he began to help and gather info. Based on the info i was given, Subject had backed v1 down the boat ramp at the bass club on tims ford lake and left the operator of v1, with his son, and his friend, on-board v1. As subject pulled the vehicle and boat trailer off the boat ramp and parked in the parking lot, operator was pulling v1 up to the courteous dock to wait on subject to get on-board v1. 

     sometime after v1 started toward the dock, operator asked his son to raise the hatch over the motor so the fumes could escape from the enclosure. Son did as his dad, operator, told him to do, and as son raised the hatch over the motor, it caused a spark, and blew up, causing fire to cover son''s face, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, and hands. Son jumped into the water to avoid further burning.  Son''s friend was also burned on the top of his right foot and jumped into the water as well.  

After son jumped into the water, he swam to the dock ramp where a nurse that was fishing helped him out of the water and got him to safety. The nurse called 911 at this time.  Friend stated that he never told anybody he was burned because he didn’t want to get into trouble and that he was ok.  

Son stated, that earlier in the day operator had stopped and filled the boat fuel tank up and had spilled fuel all over the engine. Son asked his dad, operator, if it will blow up-after the explosion, operator worked on putting the fire out with some help from by-standers. After the flames appeared to be out, operator drove v1 around the no wake zone area for a few minutes then headed back to dock v1.  

A police officer came to the docked v1 and spoke to operator then operator sprinted down the ramp toward the location of his injured son.  Son was eventually airlifted to the hospital.

We were told that all occupants of the boat were out of the water and were now back at their cottage.  I, along with office responded to the scene.  The results of our investigation are as follows.
At approximately 7:45 pm on july 21st, two male subjects were occupants of a small rowboat owned by operator that was being used on atwood lake in lange county.  A concerned neighbor saw the two men capsize the rowboat and enter the water at which time notification to ico dispatch was made.  
According to operator and occupant's account, they both stood up in the small boat and as their weight shifted, water came over the gunwale of the boat causing it to capsize sending them into the water.  Operator assured me that they were both fine and their life jackets had worked as designed because they both popped right to the surface of the water when they fell in.  I asked how they made it back to shore and was told that their friends who were on shore got into their pontoon docked at the cottage and drove out onto the lake to assist them.  I asked who drove out and she said she was on the boat but wouldn't admit to operating out to assist her friends.  She was very reluctant to answer any of my questions with any degree of detail. 
Through interviewing others on scene, subject2 told me that subject3 had driven the boat out to get her friends from the water.  I was able to detect a strong odor of alcohol as well as bloodshot, glassy eyes in all four people involved at the scene however was not able to determine when they had begun drinking.  When i arrived on scene operator and occupant were both sitting in front of their cottage with open beer bottles discussing what had just occurred with subject3 and subject2 were inside.
I interviewed subject4 who indicated to me that he witnessed operator and occupant capsize their boat.  He stated that he was the one that got the attention of subject2 and subject3 and told them about their friends who were in the water.  He stated that subject2 and subject3 got into the pontoon and subject3 operated the boat out to the men in the water.  When the boat arrived on scene subject4 stated that they threw two life preservers from the pontoon into the water for operator and occupant to grab onto.  Subject4 stated that all of the occupants on the pontoon then tried to get the sunken rowboat out of the water but were unsuccessful as it was at the bottom of the lake.
After speaking to subject4, i went back and interviewed operator again and told him that i knew they didn't have life jackets on their boat when it had capsized.  Operator assured me that he did have them on the boat and that when they capsized the life jackets were floating in the water and they were able to grab them which was a different account of what he had told me when i first interviewed him.  
I cited operator for a pfd violation and explained that i would be back out at a later date to run sonar to locate the sunken boat while ico divers would recover it.  I secured a written witness statement from subject4 regarding what he had witnessed and cleared the scene at approximately 9:30pm.
I attempted to locate the capsized boat on 7/24/17.  We ran side scan sonar and located two sunken boats that divers confirmed were not the boat belonging to operator.  We were unsuccessful in locating the boat involved in this incident.",02-17-00597,NA,NA,NA

The witness stated the boat was speeding (about 15-20 mph), causing a large wake and thought drinking may have been involved. He said the watercraft slowed down before crashing into the first row of docks. 

The deputy spoke to the owner of WC #1 who said the operator/renter left as soon as the boat had been docked by rental staff. They removed the boat from the water to determine the amount of damage. The deputy left several messages for the renter/operator to call him. He finally connected with him on 8/16/17. He said he had been the operator of the rented watercraft at the time the dock was struck. He said he remembered being in a slow wake area, so he was operating at approximately 5 mph. He said he noticed a dock ahead of him and before he could avoid hitting it, he struck it with the pontoon. He also noted that before hitting the dock, he put the throttle in reverse, slowing his speed down to around 3 mph. He said after hitting the dock on the starboard side of the watercraft, it bounced slightly off the dock. He said he looked at the pontoon and the dock and did not see any damage.

The victim advised she never reported the incident until her insurance company said she would need a police report. 

The victim/vessel operator was identified. V1 subject said that on the evening of 08/05/2017, her vessel, a 2016 Sylvan pontoon boat , was docked at the Honi Honi Bar/Unos community docks. There was a docking assistant hired by the Honi Honi Bar that helped her secure the boat and also oversees the vessels while the passengers are on the restaurant grounds. V1 subject and her husband were having dinner inside between 1600 and 1800 hours. When they returned to the community dock to retrieve their vessel, the dock attendant said that their vessel was involved in a ""hit and run"" collision. The attendant saw a black pontoon boat bearing Maryland registration ""MD 6014 CD"", reverse from his slip, begin forward motion to head into the main body of Deep Creek Lake, and failed to provide adequate distance on his starboard side to avoid striking docked vessels. The leading edge of his starboard side pontoon struck the outboard engine of V1 subject's docked Sylvan pontoon. The dock attendant shouted at the suspect vessel and attempted to make contact but she advised the operator exited the area quickly and traveled towards the Glendale Bridge. 

   V1 subject sustained damage on her outboard engine, specifically scratches and a broken handle on the outer plastic housing, along with a dent to the inner metal casing. V1 subject estimated the damage to be greater than $2000. 

   I was able to run the suspect vessel's registration and found a listed owner. When I arrived at Operator2's dock I saw a black Harris pontoon boat tied to the dock, bearing MD registration: MD 6014 CD. The pontoon had damage consistent with the dock attendant's recollection of the event, namely a significant dent and tear in the aluminum of the starboard side pontoon, along with black transfer paint from V1 subject's engine housing. I made contact with Operator2 via his phone number on file with Deep Creek Lake Management and we set a meeting for 08/11/2017 to discuss the accident.

   On 08/11/2017, V2 subjects met me at the Deep Creek Lake Discovery Center to discuss the accident. Operator2 said that he was at the Honi Honi on 08/05/2017 by himself, he was there between 1630 and 1800 hours. Operator2 said that the restaurant was very busy that day and he had to wait awhile for two beers and left soon after. Operator2 said he returned to the community dock, reversed out of the slip, and had some difficulty maneuvering in the tight quarters, he also advised there was steady vessel traffic in and out of the community dock area. Operator2 didn't recall a dock attendant yelling for his attention, or feel his starboard pontoon strike the engine of V1 subject's pontoon boat but said the damage was consistent and he would take responsibility for the accident.

    Insurance information was then exchanged between the two parties and both were informed that an Incident Report would be available for them to review.

When I arrived on scene, I met with the General Manager of Paradise Watersports.  He explained that two of his rented PWC's were involved in an accident.  There were no injuries and the parties were still on scene.  

According to Paradise Watersports, the PWC rental left at 1720 tour and the incident occurred at approximately 1800 hours.  There were three PWC guides with the rental group.  Each guide provided a written statement of the events.  The manager showed me the damage to the PWC's, which were numbered and showed who they were assigned to during that rental period.  They also provided all documentation in regards to rental agreements, liability statements and boating safety testing.  

Rental PWC #6, MD 7618 DA, was assigned to Operator2. PWC #6 had damage to the front hood.  The hood had damaged plastic components and paint transfer/scuff marks to the port side bow.  

Rental PWC #26, MD 7602 DA, was assigned to Operator1.  PWC #26 had significant fiberglass damage to the starboard side of the hull on the bow and stern.  There was also damage to the plastic components at the stern.

According to the statements given by the guides, Operator1, who was operating PWC #26, struck Operator2's PWC #6 head on.  Operator1's starboard bow went up onto the starboard hood of Operator2's ski.  When the vessels collided, Operator2 was ejected from the ski and landed in the water.  The guide stated that Operator2 informed him that he had no injuries.  The guides stated that both PWC's were travelling fast and within 100' of each other.  The guides proceeded to take the keys from the jet skis and ended the tour.  

The PWC's were out of the water and on the floating PWC docks.  Photos were taken of the damage that was observed at that time.  Mangaer stated that they would do a full assessment of the damage with the business owner to get a full estimate.  The damage was estimated to be in excess of $4,000. 

After reviewing the statements and observing the damage to the skis, the damage is consistent with what the guides witnessed. 

I spoke with Operator1 and Operator2.  I offered for them to give a written statement in regards to the events that occurred.  Both subjects refused to give a statement and stated that they want to proceed with legal counsel.  They also stated that they would not pay for the damage to the PWC's.  I informed them that charges would be pending for the case and that Paradise Watersports can pursue the cost of damages through civil court.

I met the owners of the sailboat, at the Annapolis Harbormasters' Office. Subject1 stated that they had anchored their sailboat at the mouth of Spa Creek on October 24th and returned on the morning of November 3rd. Subject1 stated that they left their sailboat on the 24th in good condition with no damage. 
Subject1 stated upon their return on the 3rd they observed significant damage to their sailboat. Subject1 stated that the roller anchor was completely destroyed; the bow pulpit was twisted and one of the stanchions broke free; and there were scratches in the fiberglass and cracks at the bow. According to Subject1 and Subject2 none of the aforementioned damage was present when they left on the 24th. I personally inspected their sailboat myself and observed the aforementioned damage and further observed significant scraping and gouges to the gel coat on the port side of the vessel. The gouges and scrapes started at mid-vessel and went all the way up to the bow. I further observed significant gel coat damage to the bow that went all the way down to fiberglass. Furthermore there was damage that extended down the bow that looked as if the anchor chain scraped against the vessel. I further observed what appeared to be footprints in two separate locations on the deck. I only observed those two footprints but did not observe any damage to the cabin area of the vessel. According to Subject2 and Subject1 nothing in the cabin was missing or had been disturbed. 
  I inquired with the Annapolis Harbormasters' Office if there was any video surveillance that could capture out to the mouth of Spa Creek but I was informed that the cameras could not capture video out that far. I then asked Subject2 and Subject1 if there were any possible suspects and they stated that their friend had found a blue sailboat located at Port Annapolis Marina in Back Creek that had significant damage to its bow. I went to Port Annapolis Marina and observed the sailboat in question with significant fiberglass damage to its bow. I talked to the marina employees and they stated that the sailboat in question had hit a day marker on the Potomac River. I asked the employees when the vessel had arrived to their marina and they stated on October 20th which would have been before Subject2 and Subject1 had departed their vessel. I asked the employees if they had any other vessels come to their marina with any significant damage to which they responded no. 
The Annapolis Harbormasters' Office is aware of the incident and will advise if any suspicious vessels are brought to their attention. At this time there are no known suspects and Subject2 and Subject1 will be taking the vessel in for repairs. All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Vessel A ramped up and came to rest on it's port side approximately 30 feet from the point of impact with a portion of Vessel A on the bank and in the water. 

The operator of Vessel A was ejected into the water and was retrieved from the water. I received the call from 911 dispatch and the operator and occupant had both been transported to the Macon Medical Center prior to my arrival. I gathered necessary information for the report as well as witness statements from the opposite shoreline. Cpl. responded to the Macon Medical Center and made contact with the victims. After toxicology reports were received weeks later Operator was arrested for BUI by Cpl.. See below Cpl. report.

I received a call at approximately 2200 hours from Cpt. in reference to a boat accident that occurred on Lake Sinclair in Baldwin County near Haslam's Marina. The driver of the vessel was being transported to the Macon Medical Center. I went to the Medical Center to interview Operator as well as his passenger. The passenger admitted to drinking alcohol throughout the day. After Operator was moved to a private room I was able to interview him. Operator admitted to consuming alcohol throughout the course of the day as well. However, due to his injuries field sobriety was not an option but I was able to conduct the Alco-Sensor FST at approximately 2330 hours that tested positive for alcohol. I also spoke with two of the Officers that responded to the incident location and both advised that there were empty alcoholic beverage containers on scene and that the Operator had a strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from his person.

On Monday, April, 3, 2017 I met with Bibb County Magistrate Judge in reference to securing a Search Warrant for the Medical Records and a Blood Sample taken from Operator. I served the Search Warrant at the Medical Center at approximately 1430 hours that same day. I was advised that the Medical Records would take approximately 7 days. However, I was able to secure the Blood Samples and they were sealed in a GBI Crime Lab Alcoho Collection Kit, to be sent for analysis. I delivered the GBI kit to the George State Patrol Perry Post to be sent via UPS to the GBI Lab in Macon, Ga. Sgt. accessed GBI DOFS on May 23, 2017 and was able to print off the results which indicated the Blood Alcohol level of .179.

I proceeded into the woods near Macintosh Run along with one St. Mary's County Firefighter. 

We searched Macintosh Run downstream for approx 100 yards until we received word that the victim was located upstream of our location. The victim was transported to the hospital in Leonardtown, Md. for treatment for mild hypothermia. During my interview with the victim she stated that they began their kayak trip around 12:00pm that day and made it approx 2 miles downstream before turning around. About halfway back to the kayak launch point, the victim became physically unable to paddle against the current and the kayak capsized. She was able to get her daughter to the shoreline and she climbed onto a partially sunken tree. She retrieved her phone and called 911 for assistance. She waited there until the fire department located her and provided initial treatment. They then assisted her out of the water to an ambulance that was waiting nearby. After conducting the interview, Officer and I retrieved the 2 kayaks from Macintosh run and I delivered them to the residence of the victim.

At approximately 1400 hours Ofc. and I were patrolling the north end of the Courtney Campbell Causeway when we noticed EMS pull into the boat ramp parking lot with their red lights and sirens activated. Ofc and I drove a short distance to the boat ramp by boat to see if we could provide assistance to the EMS personnel.

While on scene Tampa EMS was treating a man who was laying in the water on the boat ramp. During the time EMS was treating the man in the water, they asked the victim what happened and he stated to them that he fell off of a jet ski. The victim was complaining that his back was hurting really bad and that he had trouble feeling his legs. EMS got the victim stabilized and that is when I identified the man. Operator stated to me that he was test driving a jet ski (FL 3897 PE) that he was going to buy when he hit a wave and lost control and fell of the jet ski. Operator hit the water a few times and came up out of the water and had really bad back pain.

He said that two teenagers on other jet skis saw what happened to him and came over to his location to help him. That is when one of the teenagers pulled Operator to shore and the other towed the jet ski back to the boat ramp. At the boat ramp with Operator was subject who was the gentleman who was selling the jet ski to Operator. Subject stated to me that he did not see what happened to Operator but saw him when he was towed back to shore and found out what happened to him. 

Operator was transported to St. Joseph's Hospital where he was treated for his injuries. I spoke with Operator on the phone on September 5, 2017 and he stated to me that he broke his back and that he was going to have surgery to repair the damage done when he fell off the jet ski. Operator stated that he did not hit an object in the water or any other vessel. The was no damage on the jet ski whatsoever. Ofc. and I tried to locate the two teenagers who witnessed the accident and towed Operator back to shore, but we were not successful as they had already left the scene when we arrived. 

A few days later I received a phone call from Operator stating that he remembered that he hit another jet ski on the starboard side of the vessel that he was on. He also stated that he was going approximately 60 mph when he hit the other jet ski. I asked Operator why he changed his story and the day of the accident he stated to me that he fell off the jet ski he was test driving. Operator stated to me that he remembered what happened to him after he was treated at the hospital.

I then went to the house of Subject who was selling the jet ski to Operator. At the house I observed the jet ski that Subject was test driving. I did not see any damage to the jet ski whatsoever. I documented the jet ski with pictures.   

On September 20, 2017, I received another phone call from Operator. He asked me if I had found the other jet ski that he hit on the day of his accident. I asked him again why he changed his original story from the day of  the accident. He stated to me that he just remembered that he hit another jet ski. I told him that I did not see any damage on the jet ski that he was test driving and that his new story did not match up with the evidence on the jet ski. 

No citations were issued, and it is my belief through my training and experience that there is no way possible Operator hit another jet ski at 60mph and no damage was done at all. Also, there were no other complaints from any other jet skis that day about being in an accident with a red jet ski.

No further action taken at this time.

The boat accident occurred at approximately 7:18 PM according to the SO reports.  The SO responded to the scene of the accident and documented all persons involved.  To the knowledge of the SO and interviews by WCO, O1 was operating V1 accompanied by P1.  

O1 was pulling three individuals, P2, P3, and P4, on a “Super Mable” tube with an affixed 60’ rope tied off to a cleat on V1.  During interviews, WCO determined P1 was intoxicated, unknown PBT, and was micromanaging every move O1 was doing while driving V1.  

O1 stated that he did as he was told by P1 on how to operate because this was the first time driving V1 and he wanted to drive V1 again in the future.  Just prior to the accident, O1 was travelling westbound at approximately 30 mph.  At this time, V1 was pulling P2, P3, and P4 on the tube.  O1 was driving V1 approximately 60-75’ from the edge of the cabin owners docks.  As V1 was near the dock, O1 under the direction of P1 made a subtle turn to port travelling southwest at this time.  

O1 under the direction of P1 then made a hard turn to starboard maintaining the approximate speed of 30 mph.  During this turn to starboard, the tube which was being pulled by V1 with a 60’ tubing rope was forced towards the direction of the docks which were all affixed to the shoreline and well under the 60’ standard required dock length in South Dakota.  

As O1 finished turning V1 towards starboard, the tube had crashed into the dock.  The collision occurred at the end of the dock furthest from the shoreline.  The tube was angled slightly at the time of the collision and the passengers were seated as follows:  P2 was seated on the tube closest to the dock, P3 was seated in the middle, and P4 was seated on the outside in relationship to the dock.  At the time of the collision, P2, P3, and P4 were all thrown from the tube and were floating in the water.  

P2, P3, and P4 were all wearing lifejackets at the time of the collision.  O1 realized the collision occurred and throttled down V1.  O1 removed his shoes and other miscellaneous clothing and entered the water to recover P2.  P4 recovered P3 from the water and brought her to the dock.  P4 left the scene shortly after recovering P3.  O1 recovered P2 and brought her to the beach.  Shortly after, O1 ran into the cabin to put on dry clothes and to call 911.  During the rescues from the water, P1 remained in V1 stunned and motionless.  Eventually P1 walked V1 onto the lift and secured V1. 
 
At approximately 7:30 PM, Lake County Ambulance Service arrived on scene and transported P2 and P3 to Madison Regional Health in Madison, SD for their injuries noted above.  P2 was air lifted from Madison Regional Health to the Avera Hospital in Sioux Falls due to the severity of her injuries.  
 
The SO left the scene of the accident at approximately 8:00 PM, and arrived at Madison Regional Health to speak with the injured parties.  SO was able to make contact with P3 and P4 and discussed details to the accident and observed their injuries (See SO Report).  SO completed their duties at the hospital at approximately 9:00 PM.
 
During follow up interviews, WCO heard from all operators and passengers involved that P1 had just as much responsibility in the crash as O1.  P1 was over the shoulder of O1 instructing and manipulating how O1 was operating.  All parties involved including P1 stated that his intoxication level was beyond the legal limit of driving V1.  WCO believes the lack of judgment on O1, and the level of intoxication of P1 contributed to the accident.

Upon arrival of the scene the boat had already left and the channel marker was pushed into the water just above the waterline. 

The reporting citizen had written down the FL registration number and we followed up with the owner/operator at his home where the violation was documented with a Uniform Boating Citation. Based off of this information we were able to identify the registered owner. 

After reading Operator his Miranda warning off of an agency prepared text we questioned him on his involvement with the vessel accident. Operator admitted to operating the vessel as well as having knowledge of his vessel striking Marker 24 in Crystal River. Operator stated that while operating his vessel and traveling east on the Crystal River he turned the vessel to port while crossing a wake made by a passing vessel. 

The motion caused by wake of the passing vessel threw his passenger out of the starboard side of the vessel. After Occupant was thrown out of the vessel Operator was thrown out of the vessel as well. Operator was not wearing the vessel kill lanyard and the boat continued to travel without anyone on board.  

The vessel then began to make circular motions in the water eventually colliding with Marker 24. Shortly after impact with the channel marker the vessel shut off and came to rest approximately 100 yards South East of marker 24.  At this point the two individuals in the water were picked up by good Samaritan who transported  them back to their vessel. After returning to their vessel Operator and Occupant left the scene and returned to their residence.

V1 occupant said he saw the guy in the other boat headed in their direction. He said the other boat came from the area at marker 36E. V1 occupant said, ""The other guy must have had a problem with his motor or a death wish."" I asked him why he would say that and he replied, ""Because he cut in front of operator.""

I continued to talk to V1 occupant about the incident. He told me they were going about 2,000 to 2,500 RPM's as they were going to Galt's Ferry. He said he knew that 4,000 RPM's was about 38 MPH. I asked him about what side of the channel they were on as they rounded the corner from Sweetwater headed to the S-Curves. V1 occupant told me the corner from Sweetwater was shallow and they came across and headed to the corner at marker 36E. V1 occupant pointed to the left side of the channel on an overhead map and I asked him about being on the wrong side. 

He said they were going to cut the corner traveling down the lake. V1 occupant said Operator1 tried to go right to avoid hitting the other boat. V1 occupant said he does not remember hitting the boat but did recall coming up from the water and holding onto the side of Operator1's capsized boat about midway down the hull on the passenger side. He said that he remembered Operator1 being directly to his right toward the stern of the boat. He told Operator1 to hang on but Operator1 became too weak and slipped beneath the surface of the water. V1 occupant also recalled seeing the other boater, hanging onto the bow of Operator1's boat. He said the other guy was about half out of the water.

After reviewing all the evidence that has been made available to me at the time of this report I have concluded that Operator1 being on the wrong side of the channel at marker 36E is at fault for the incident. I base this conclusion on 2 factors. The first factor being that V1 occupant said in his interview on February 4, 2017 that they were going to cut the corner as they headed to Galt's Ferry to continue fishing. The second factor being the downloaded information from Garmin Echomap GPS unit showing several hundred plotted GPS points. RFC was able to show the exact route that he took on the day of the incident. From the time Operator2 launched his boat until the boat was towed from the scene of the incident there are latitude and longitude coordinates, speeds, headings, times, and dates putting Operator2 boat in extremely close if not exact positions on Allatoona Lake.",A004486,34.14,-84.65,NC

On June 23, 2017, I responded to the gate for a female that was on a standup paddle board that was almost struck by a wakeboard boat.

NARRATIVE
On June 23, 2017, I was patrolling Rockport State Park when our gate staff contacted me. They explained that a woman was at the gate that was almost hit by a wake board boat. I asked if there was any injuries. My staff said no. 

I responded to the gate and made contact with two females.  One person said that she was on a paddle board near Rockport Estates when a wake boarding boat almost hit her. She went on to explain that the wakeboard boat ran over her board causing damage. She did not have any injuries and was wearing a lifejacket at the time. She said that the driver of the wakeboard boat stopped and asked if everyone was okay. They exchanged information on shore. She said that she wanted me to talk to the driver to explain the law about getting too close to other people on the water. I asked if she would be willing to sign a citation or felt the need for me to issue a citation. She explained that all she wanted was for him to cover the damage to the standup paddle board. 

I followed her over to the pull off to take photos of the damage. I noted that there was several cracks in the board along the side and near the back of the board. I also saw that the rubber pad was discolored. Through my training this discoloration is from when the wake boarding boat crossed over the board. Photos were taken of the board and attached to the report. 

Once I completed my investigation I asked her again if she wanted me to issue any citations. She said no, but wanted me to confirm the boat owners information if I did make contact with him. 

I then got on our patrol boat and located the vessel that was involved with the accident. The driver did confess to coming too close to the standup paddle boarder. I explained the laws that he broke and that the female did not want to press charges. I did confirm his phone number and made sure that he would pay for the damages to the standup paddle boarder. 

Once finished I cleared the scene. 

CONCLUSION
SUPer saw the vessel coming towards her and made several attempts to alert the operator of the vessel. She did jump off the standup paddle prior to the accident. Operator2 did not see her and struck the paddle board. I believe that operator2 failed to keep a proper look out while operating his vessel and was at fault for the accident.

On 01/03/2017, at about 11:00 p.m., this vessel was operating on Case Inlet, at North Bay, located near Allyn, WA in Mason county.  

According to Law Enforcement on 01/04/2017, at about 01:08 a.m. they were dispatched to a boating incident in the area of SR 3 and the Allyn Water Front.  The reporting party advised his friend (Operator) who he met about two weeks prior was missing.  Both men lived aboard vessels that were anchored near the Allyn Water Front.

Friend told Officers that Operator wanted to head back to shore to grab his tools which he had left in the bed of his pick-up truck.  He said that the two of them had been drinking and smoking weed.  He said that Operator left in what was described as a “yellow kayak” sometime around 11:30 p.m.  

Friend said that Operator had never been on a kayak before and he was not wearing a life jacket.  After about an hour Friend began to worry when Operator had not returned.  He then called dispatch on Operator's phone because he was afraid that something had happened to him.

At about 03:00 a.m., the US Coast Guard arrived on scene and searched the area utilizing a helicopter.  The search turned up negative results up until Law Enforcement left the scene at about 04:30 a.m.  In addition to the helicopter the USCG advised that they would be sending two water craft to the area to assist in the search.  

Law Enforcement Officers checked the bed of Operator's truck that was parked in the parking lot located at the Boat House in Allyn.  The tool belt was located in the bed of the pick-up truck.  Officers searched the shoreline southbound with K9 Jano for several hundred yards and were unable to locate any kayaks matching the description of Operator's kayak.  

On 01/04/2017, at about 09:49 a.m., Law Enforcement responded to East Nelson Road and then walked to the waterline/shore to check for a kayak on the beach located by aircraft in reference to this case.  Officers checked the beach.  The kayak was located further North.  They walked the shore and located a yellow kayak and paddle inverted in the water just off the shore. 

Officers began to leap frog checking the shore line towards Allyn.  They walked all the foot accessible shore line from East Nelson Road to Drum Street in Allyn.  This took place during high tide so not all the shore was accessible.  Another Officer arrived by boat to check the involved boat that was anchored a distance out.  There was no one on board and no evidence of a disturbance.  At about 06:00 p.m., Officers conducted additional shoreline patrols at low tide.  This was done until dark with nothing located.

At about 10:40 p.m., Officers arrived at the assumed (Operator's) boat.  It was the only boat in the Allyn waters.  The boat name SCAMPER out of Vancouver BC.  This is an old enclosed cabin wood hull boat, about 25 feet long.  There was no one on board.  

After discovering that the vessel was unoccupied the information was radioed to the US Coast Guard.  A short time later it came to light that the missing person – Operator – lived on board the SCAMPER and the complainant – Friend lived on board a second vessel, only described as a sailboat.  The sailboat was nowhere to be seen.  It is believed that Friend fled the area during the hours of darkness.  It is unknown why Friend fled. 

NOTE:  Operator has a confirmed Felony Warrant out of Pierce County and Friend has numerous (8) misdemeanor warrants for his arrest.  It is likely both subjects will avoid contact with Law Enforcement.

UPDATE:  On 02/17/2017, a body, matching the description of Operator, was located by 2 kayakers about 500 yards off of the North Point of Stretch Island.  According to Law Enforcement, the body matched the description given for Operator.  He was also found close to where he was originally reported missing.  His body was recovered and turned over to the Mason County Coroner.  Report is pending.

He was running about 60% throttle, which has the bow raised up in the air, making it difficult to see.  Vessel 1's steering console is at the rear, middle of the boat.  One of his passengers was standing in front of the console, putting the fishing net away.  Vessel 1 instantly stopped and he thought he hit a submerged log.  His passengers were thrown forward inside Vessel 1.  One passenger had a cut on his forehead and nose.  Another had a 1-1/2 inch cut on top of her head that ended up requiring 5 staples.  The operator and another passenger were uninjured.  Vessel 1's operator said he never saw Vessel 2 until after the impact.  He admits he should have made his passengers remain seated and he should have been operating at full speed to bring his bow down so it wouldn't obstruct his view.  He estimated his speed at 20MPH.

Vessel 2's operator stated that Vessel 1 was running full speed upriver.  He could not see anyone in Vessel 1 over the bow.  Vessel 1 is a ""bay"" boat with sweeping up bow with a windshield and a center console, 4 people on boat and a 90hp pump (under-powered).  When the operator of Vessel 2 realized that Vessel 1's operator didn't see Vessel 2, the occupants of Vessel 2 waved their arms and yelled at Vessel 1, but Vessel 1's operator didn't hear them.  Vessel 1 his Vessel 2 at full speed broadside.  Vessel 2's operator was thrown from the boat and his father-in-law dove into the front passenger seat.  Vessel 2's operator stated that this collision was bound to happen sooner or later with Vessel 1's operator having his sight blocked as it was.  He shouldn't have been going so fast, or at all.  It was an unsafe craft.  The traffic on the river was high.  Vessel 1 could have at least had someone spotting for him.  Both occupants of Vessel 2 suffered only minor bumps and bruises, although the passenger also had swelling in his lower leg.

The investigator stated that Vessel 1 had just landed a salmon and were returning to their starting point to make another trolling pass.  Vessel 2 was also trolling for salmon.  The operator of Vessel 2 was standing at the tiller handle of his trolling motor and was thrown overboard upon impact.  He was able to get hold of the back of his boat and kill the trolling motor.  He then got back in his boat.  He estimated his speed at 1-2MPH.

The operator of Vessel 1 admitted during the investigation that he was not able to see ahead of him due to the bow of vessel 1 and that one of his passengers was standing in front of him as he drove.  He also stated that there was no doubt that he was in the wrong when the crash happened.

The operator of Vessel 2 stated that he saw Vessel 1 coming at him at a fast rate and was sure they were going to collide.  He said he was waving his arms and yelling and the operator of Vessel 1 never saw or heard him or his passenger who was also waving and yelling prior to impact.

At approximately 1930 hours I received a call from FWC Dispatch Center in Tampa, Florida in regards to a boating accident that occurred earlier that day. I arrived on scene at 5130 N Jamaica Street in Tampa, Florida at approximately 2100 hours and made contact with the reporting party.

Operator1 stated to me that he was operating his jet ski (FL 0099 PZ) at a low rate of speed near the Courtney Campbell Causeway around 1800 hours when he heard a noise coming from behind him. Operator1 turned his head to see what the noise was and saw a green jet ski heading in his direction at a high rate of speed from the starboard side of his jet ski. Operator1 then turned his jet ski toward the port side and accelerated to try and avoid getting hit by the green jet ski. As Operator1 was turning his vessel the green jet ski hit the aft section of his jet ski on the starboard side.

Operator1 was thrown from his vessel into the water and his vessel overturned. Operator1 then flipped his jet ski back over and drove it back to the boat ramp. Operator1 stated that he did not get a good look at the vessel or the operator and that the other jet ski just took off and did not stop to help.

Due to the time delay of the call and the little information that was given to me by Operator1 I was unable to locate the other jet ski involved in the accident. Operator1 stated that there were no other vessels in the area to witness the accident. Operator1 is not being charged in regards to this accident and there was no injuries reported at the time of my investigation.

This then caused the engine to not start. As the boat was floating away more water took over the boat causing it sink from the stern.

This was reportedly the first time vessel A had been used this season (2017) and it had recently been serviced by marina staff. After departing the marina and idling through the ""no wake"" area, the operator throttled up (gunned it). Then, after traveling approximately one hundred yards and getting up on plane, vessel A lost power. Smoke was then observed billowing near the stern/engine area. The operator then lifted the hatch covering the engine and observed a rolling flame. He then dropped the hatch, ordered the occupants to the forward section of vessel A, then waved down a passing vessel (unknown). After they boarded the unknown vessel, the operator observed the Halon system activate, which appeared to extinguish the fire. Vessel A was towed to the marina''s sailboat ramp thereafter.

While NRO was inspecting vessel A, he observed a plastic bag stuffed in the fuel inlet and noticed that the gas cap was missing. The operator stated that someone had lost the cap when it was fueled. NRO also observed what appeared to be oil in the bilge, below the engine. Burnt fiberglass and wiring was also visible. 

After consulting with four boat mechanics, NRO has reason to believe that the engine may have shut down due to a loss in pressure (hydraulic fluid leak) of the trim in the lower unit, possibly due to cracked or worn hoses. The fire may have started when the hydraulic fluid dripped or sprayed onto the engine block or exhaust manifold, thereafter.

The wake came over the bow of the vessel and caused the vessel to flood. Passengers on the vessel advised him to stop, and when he shifted into neutral the vessel nosed down into the water. This caused further flooding resulting in swamping. The swamping of the vessel in addition to the wake and passenger action caused the vessel to capsize.

Upon interviewing subjects, the canoe was recently purchased and only been used 1 time previously.  They put the canoe in the creek, put their life jackets on, and set out to go paddle the creek.  Upon boarding the canoe, they both stated that the canoe felt as if it was going to tip over.  Once on the creek, which was high from recent rains, the canoe floated them downstream quicker than expected.  They struck a tree that was growing out from the bank up through the water.  They stayed pinned against the tree for about a minute and when subject1 tried to free them with a paddle, they capsized.
They both held on to each other and the bank of the creek while yelling for help.  A witness, who had left the scene before we arrived, called 911 and requested assistance.  They lost the canoe after it sank and 2 paddles during the incident.  The canoe has not been recovered and no vessel identifiers were known at the time.

They lifted the PWC up off of the trailer and showed me a crack in the fiberglass that was approximately 18 inches long. Subject told me that when they picked up the PWC on July 9, 2017, that it was partially submerged. He also said that the renters had rented the PWC and a pontoon boat for twenty four hours, which started on July 8, 2017.

Subject2 told me that he and Operator were the only ones that had operated the PWC on Saturday, July 8, 2017 and that they only did so for a couple of hours because of the weather. Subject2 also told me that neither of them had hit anything with the PWC and that on the next day, Sunday, July 9, 2017, they woke up and noticed that the PWC had been taking on water.

Due to the high water, debris collected below the bridge and blocked all three passage ways.  I arrived on scene at approximately 2:13PM.  By the time I arrived, all of the boats and occupants were out of the water and Washington County EMS was on scene (Run #1715900).  I observed two subjects in an ambulance being prepared for transport to Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown.  

 I made contact with the two subjects in the ambulance and identified them.  Operator2 was visibly shaken from the accident but did not have any apparent injuries other than some scrapes and bruises.  V2’s son had a cut above his right eye and some bruising on the right side of his face.  I asked Operator2 what happened.  

Operator2 explained they were floating down the river and observed all of the passage ways under the bridge were blocked with wood debris from the previous rain storms.  Operator2 stated she could not stop her canoe as she neared the passage way and struck her husband's canoe which was hung up on a log.  Operator2 stated her vessel capsized after striking the other vessel.  Operator2 advised she and her son went into the water and were sucked under the debris.  Operator2 stated her husband, Operator1, rescued them out of the water on the other side of the bridge.

 After the ambulance departed, I made contact with Operator1.  I asked Operator1 to describe the boat accident to me.  I noted that Operator1' depiction was identical to what Operator2 had told me.  Operator1 stated once he observed the navigational hazard, he tried to get his boat to shore but the water was moving too fast.  Operator1 explained his canoe hit the log blocking the passage ways forcing his vessel to turn sideways becoming hung up on the debris.  Operator1 advised the other canoe, unable to stop, broadsided his vessel on the rear starboard side.  Operator1 stated his wife's canoe then capsized.  

 I asked Operator1 if anyone else was in his wife's canoe at the time of the accident.  Operator1 stated subject1 was seated in the front of Operator2' canoe.  Operator1 advised when the vessel capsized, Subject1 was able to self-rescue.  I asked Operator1 who was occupying his canoe during the accident.  Operator1 advised his son was in the middle of his vessel and Subject2 was in the front.  Operator1 stated they made it to shore safely after the accident.  

 Operator1 advised there were three life jackets in each boat, but only the children were wearing them at the time of the accident.  Operator1 advised he has routinely made this same float on the Conococheague for the past 15 years and has never seen debris collect on the bridge as it did that day.  Operator1 admitted to having three Pabst Blue Ribbon beers before the accident.  Based on my observations, alcohol was a factor in the accident.  

 I photographed the vessels and the log blocking the aqueduct (See attached photographs).  There was only cosmetic damages done to the vessels.  I asked Operator1 if he would give me a written statement describing the accident.  Operator1 agreed and provided me a written statement (See attached statement).

 I cleared the scene at approximately 3:15PM.

 At approximately 3:50PM, I arrived at Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown to assess the injuries.  I met them in the emergency room area.  Son’s only injuries were the cut above the right eye and the bruising on the right side of his face.  Operator2 was in better spirits but had minor cuts/scrapes and some swelling of her left leg.  An X-ray was performed on her leg but Operator2 advised nothing was broken.  Operator2 advised the doctor ordered a precautionary CT scan of her brain since she had undergone brain surgery in 2013.

On 04/18/2017, after obtaining and utilizing information from Rockford City Fire and Rescue Reports obtained through FOIA Request, I located and interviewed boat accident victim.

Operator1 indicated he took his 10''00"" yellow (unknown make/model) one man kayak to the Rock River to go fishing.  This yellow vinyl and plastic kayak was purchased by Operator1''s girlfriend, at a garage sale 5-7 years earlier for $100.00.  Operator1 never observed a make/model on the vessel but indicated it had a current Paddle Pass attached.  He arrived at the Rock River at approximately 9:00 a.m. and carried his kayak to the East shoreline 50 yards downstream from Fordam Dam where he launched his vessel.  A P.F.D. was worn by Operator1''s account as he paddled upstream towards the base of the dam. 

At approximately 11:30 a.m., Operator1 indicated he began to notice being drawn closer to the base of the dam near the turbulent water.  He began to paddle downstream into a strong 10-15 mph. wind, but it was described feeling like he was paddling in air because he was unable to navigating away from the dam.  Operator1 noticed his kayak began swamping from the overflowing waters of the dam.  Operator1 indicated once the kayak filled up so far with water, it capsized ejected him into the river.  Operator1 advised he held onto the overturned kayak and began yelling for help.  

Two workers from a nearby factory located S.W. of the dam who observed the incident ran to Operator1''s aid.  They jumped the fence at the catwalk above Operator1 along the top of the dam and lowered a chain down to Operator1 who grabbed for the tether as his kayak sunk.  Rockford Fire and rescue arrived shortly after and lifted Operator1 from the river using an extended ladder boom.  Operator1 was transported to Swedish American Hospital and treated for Hypothermia and exhaustion.  Operator1 complained at the interview of ongoing pain in his right shoulder from holding onto the chain tether provided by the factory workers. The kayak was never recovered.  Department Point Of Sale record shows Operator1 had purchased a paddle pass for a kayak August of 2016'' with a resident fishing license.

This vessel was approaching at a high rate of speed and was blowing its horn and its occupants were waving their hands frantically. 

The occupants yelled that they had an unconscious  man on board that they found floating in the water face down next to a jet ski. Myself and the officers from Baltimore County Marine Unit jumped onto the vessel, picked the unconscious man up and placed him on the bow of the boat where it was more flat and open. The victim had occasional agonal respirations and not breathing adequately. In addition, the victim did not have a carotid or radial pulse and therefore we began chest compressions. 

An AED was then brought to the scene a minute or two later from the office and the victims chest was exposed and dried off with a nearby towel. The AED analyzed the heart rhythm and one shock was advised and delivered. After a few more minutes of CPR the victim began to breathe on his own, and move spontaneously. The victim was then placed on a backboard and moved off the bystander vessel and onto the dock. Firefighters and EMS from the Baltimore County Fire Department arrived on scene and took over care. 

We found a wallet on the victim which positively identified him. Before departing for the hospital the victim was following commands and talking. The only noticeable external injuries were that of some swelling to his forehead. The victim was then transported to Johns Hopkins Bayview in Baltimore by Baltimore County Fire/EMS. He was wearing a lifejacket at the time and had his engine cutoff switch still attached to his wrist.

Baltimore County Marine Unit advised that they would handle the investigation of the boat accident. The PWC (2017 Yamaha PWC Maryland registration: MD 6091 CS) was brought to the Strawberry Point dock by another bystander who also was involved in the rescue of the victim. The bystanders stated that they found the victim and PWC just around the bend from our pier on Frog Mortar Creek. Baltimore County Police impounded the PWC at Deckelman Marine Group's facility on Hopkins Creek.

On 10-27-17 at approximately 1330 hours, I of The Florida Fish Wildlife Commission, was on duty in Monroe County State of Florida. I was on patrol in uniform, in a marked vehicle when I was dispatched to a boating accident with injuries. 

	I contacted the reporting party who stated that a French tourist had left in an ambulance from his hotel, and had told him that he had been injured on a PWC tour. I tracked down the PWC group which was Fury Water Sports. I talked with the tour guide who stated that he had finished a tour earlier, but that no one had reported any injuries or a crash to him. I inspected all of the PWC’s but could not find any damage to the craft or anything to document on them reference the crash.

	At this time, Ofc. of the FWC called me and stated that she was meeting with the victim, Victim at the hospital on Stock Island. Victim had been operating a PWC (FL9162RD)(V1) Due to Victim not speaking English, a translator at the hospital provided her services. Victim stated that during free time on the PWC he had been struck in the hip by a fellow tourist on accident. He did not report the injury because he did not know the tour guide had asked about injuries. Due to the translator being unable to write a statement for Victim, information collected from him could not be written down. Also due to the type of injury (broken hip) no pictures were taken.

	I received a phone call from a tour guide; a few minutes later and she stated that she had the operator of the striking vessel with her at the hotel that had reported the accident. I arrived on scene  where I met with her who introduced me to Operator2 who had been operating one of the PWC’s (FL2202RF)(V2) With subject as a translator, I could gather that Operator2 had accidently struck Victim when he lost control while trying to turn. I had her write down Operator2’s statement and had him sign it. ;

This accident occurred near/at Channel Marker 12. This location is approximately .53 miles west of the Anclote River Park Boat Ramp. A 2002, 15ft, multicolored Gheenoe with three people on board was traveling in a northeasterly direction towards the Anclote River Park Boat Ramp. The Gheenoe struck channel marker #12. The operator, Operator sustained injuries to his face. The occupants, Occupant1 (6 year old child), sustained a fractured hand, and Occupant2 sustained multiple injuries, which resulted in his death shortly after arriving at the hospital. 

V-1 struck channel marker “12”, located in the Anclote River. Channel Marker “12” is made-up of a steel I-beam with a red triangle day board constructed of plywood with the number “12” attached to it. The impact causes V-1 to roll / pitch towards starboard, resulting in numerous gouges and scratches in the fiberglass on the port side of V-1 from the bow to the stern. 
During the collision, Operator was ejected from V-1 (unknown as to which side of V-1 he was ejected), and Occupant2, with his back toward the front of the vessel, possibly struck the steel beam of the channel marker causing him to fall on the deck of V-1. This resulted in his injuries. 

Occupant1 (who was seated on Occupant2's lap) was shielded from coming into direct contact with the channel marker however; he too fell on the deck of V-1 with Occupant2. Both Occupant2 and Occupant1 struck the fishing rods that were in the fishing rod holders prior to falling on the deck of V-1.

After the collision, V-1 remained in gear, traveling in circles (clockwise), with both Occupant2 and Occupant1 onboard. Operator stated he immediately swam to V-1, and pulled the lanyard out from the outboard, to stop the motor. The Dolphin Watch Tour Boat was just on their way back to their dock, which is located in Tarpon Springs, when the Captain of the tour boat observed Operator attempting to board V-1.

Tour boat operator approached V-1, in an attempt to see if they needed assistance. As Tour boat operator got closer to V-1, he saw Occupant2 stretched-out on the rear deck of V-1. Tour boat operator stated they threw a rope to Operator and pulled V-1 from the shallow waters. Tour boat operator stated they grabbed Occupant1 and placed him inside their vessel. 

Tour boat operator stated he was in contact with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) throughout this incident. Tour boat operator then towed V-1 with Operator and Occupant2 onboard to the Anclote River Park Boat Ramp, where both a Pasco County Sheriff Deputy and FWC/DLE Officers were waiting.  

Upon the arrival of the emergency medical services (Pasco County Fire Rescue), all three subjects were transported to the Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point Hospital, to be treated for their injuries.

As a result of the accident, Occupant2 sustained blunt head trauma, which resulted in his death. Operator sustained head trauma, bleeding on the brain, and abrasions on both of his knees, and Occupant1 sustained a fracture in his left hand / middle finger.

Officers responded to wittenberg access (175 wildlife access road) to investigate.  The night was clear with a full moon with mild temperatures.  The officers met with the operator and passenger of the pontoon boat.  Operator stated immediately prior to the accident, they were fishing on the pontoon near harbor town drive.  They had decided to leave the location and go to wittenberg access area to load the pontoon.  

They travelled around the bend in the lake and on to the main channel of the lake.  He advised he was travelling approximately 15 to 17 miles per hour and suddenly struck a floating dock with a pwc secured on top that was floating in the main channel.  Upon impact, the left pontoon and front of the pontoon collided with the dock and pwc.  

After striking the dock, they travelled to wittenberg access to meet officials.   Occupant stated she fell forward from her original seated position onto the pontoon deck.  Operator was thrown forward toward the console. He sustained a cut on his right eyebrow and bridge of his nose.   Subjects did not seek medical attention greater than first aid.  

Operator loaded the pontoon boat to the trailer and removed it from the water.  Officers inspected the pontoon and observed the left pontoon spray flare bent upward and small scratches on the pontoon.  No other damage on the pontoon was visible and reported by operator. 

Officer spoke with the owner of the pwc.  He was unable to advise the exact day and time the dock and pwc was observed secure.  The pwc and ezdock was attached to a wooden dock.  He advised the pwc was inoperable prior to the incident and would not work. The dock was a drive-on, plastic, ez dock brand.  The dock pins had been removed that secured it to the shoreline's wooden deck.  He advised the incident caused a hole in the top left in the plastic ez dock and damaged the top front of the pwc hood.  He also stated the damage was negligible due to the value and inoperability of the pwc.

It should be noted prior to the incident, lake hickory had received numerous spring rains resulting in high water levels.  This possibly contributed to the break away of the dock.  He also had advised that possibly the dock had been tampered with due to missing hinge pin bolts.

 on 04-10-2017, no report was taken due to the minimal damage and no injury greater than first aid reported.  On 06-27-2017 operator contacted officer requesting a report for insurance purposes.  He had further advised the left pontoon had a indention dents at the nose cone on the left and right sides just below the spray fins.  The pontoon would require replacement at a cost of $5000.00 per carolina coach and marine boat sales company.

It was very rough waters due to the waves, both boats collided in the water.

The owner of Vessel 2 stated that his boat was tied to the dock.  Vessel 1 came in too fast and collided with Vessel 3, that was also docked, and then hit Vessel 2.  He estimated that Vessel 1 was at half-throttle.

The owner of Vessel 3 did not give a narrative on his report however he told Law Enforcement, at a later date, that he was away from his boat getting his trailer when the crash occurred.  (See investigator's statements)

Per the investigator's report they were dispatched to the report of a boat crash at the Willamette Park ramp on the Willamette River.  At the time they were at the Columbia River Patrol Office and they made phone contact with the complainant to confirm their location.  They spoke to the injured party from Vessel 2 who stated that she was holding Vessel 2 against the dock when Vessel 1 hit the side of Vessel 2 with the tip of Vessel 1.  The operator of Vessel 1 was speaking to the owner of Vessel 2 and exchanging information at the time she was speaking to Law Enforcement at around 11:07PM.  She also stated that it was too dark to determine damage, so they didn't need Law Enforcement to respond.

On 07/10/17 Law Enforcement was contacted by the owner of Boat 3 who advised his boat was damaged and he was unable to get the operator of Vessel 1 to cooperate.  The owner of Vessel 3 stated it was parked along the dock with his passenger.  She saw the operator of Vessel 1 attempt to drive his boat between Vessels 2 and 3.  She saw Vessel 1 strike Vessel 2 with its bow, then strike Vessel 3 with its stern.  There was corresponding damage documented to Vessel 2 on the port side mid gunnel and damage to Vessel 3 on the starboard side mid gunnel.  The owner of Vessel 3 said no one in his party was able to contact the operator of Vessel 1 before he loaded his boat and left.

Boat 2's operator was then contacted and he was away from Vessel 2, getting his trailer when the crash occurred.  He said when he returned to Vessel 2 he spoke to the operator of Vessel 1.  He said the operator of Vessel 1 said it was the current and wakes of other boats that caused Vessel 1 to strike Vessel 2.  Vessel 2's owner advised that he didn't know there was a third boat involved.  He did say that he thought it was foolish for the operator of Vessel 1 to try to pull between the two parked boats.  He said ""it was the 4th of July and there were boats everywhere, but people were waiting their turn to get their boat out.  Then this guy comes flying up in between the boats.""  He said that he and the operator of Vessel 1 exchanged information and he thought Vessel 1's insurance could cover any damage.  The investigator asked about alcohol and Vessel 2's owner did not believe that Vessel 1's operator had been drinking.  He provided the investigator with the contact information and photos he had taken the night of the accident.

The investigator then left multiple messages for the operator of Vessel 1.  Later in the day he received a call from Vessel 1's operator who stated there were no other persons on his boat and it did not have any mechanical problems.  He stated that he pulled into the Willamette Park launch along with several other boats.  He said it was very crowded following the 4th of July fireworks.  He pulled in between the boats at the dock and shut off his engine.  He knew he struck both Vessel 2 and Vessel 3.  He added that he didn't have control because there were so many wakes on the water.  The investigator asked why he didn't wait and get in line like the other boats in front of he and he said ""there was room to go between.""  The investigator then asked why he turned off the motor instead of leaving it on to keep control of his boat and he replied, “I was getting too close to the boats and the shore.  I wanted to be safe.""

The only injury sustained was to the passenger in Vessel 2 who suffered whiplash when Vessel 1 struck Vessel 2.

No mention was made if any citations were issued.

NOTE:  Vessel 1's operator told the investigator that no one else was on his boat, but on his report he stated there were three people on board, and the investigator listed the two teenagers in his report.

While officer's were responding to the marina, Post 14 contacted officer's and advised that the child was at the Bruin boat ramp and that EMS was responding; that the child was laying on the dock next to the boat ramp. 

Officer's changed course and headed to Bruin boat ramp and arrived at approx: 2:30 P.M. As officer's were approaching the boat dock, observed ambulance taking off. Bystanders stated that the father was very upset and told them that he and his boy was kneeboarding and a boat ran over their rope causing the boy to be injured  and that the subject's on the other boat cursed him and left. 

The father asked the bystanders to watch over his vehicle, boat and dog while he went to the hospital in the ambulance with his son. Officer retrieved the KY registration off the boat: KY 5221 JJ, briefly looked for damage and returned to patrol vessel. Post 14 advised that the other suspects were at the marina and that they may be trying to leave.

As officer's approached the marina there were several peopled around the office: the Deputy, a TPR unit, two corp engineers along with the two male worker's working at the marina, operator of the vessel that ran over the rope, another adult male and three male children. 

Officer and myself approached the subjects and asked for identification.  Operator1 stated that he was the operator of the vessel, a rental (Pontoon) KY 0191 KM, that he was moving at 3/4 throttle around Little Gimlet and while passing a boat that was not moving, ran over that boat rope causing it to jerk and spin. 

Stated he noticed a boy sitting on the gunwale and when he caught the rope with his motor that the boy ended up in the floor of the boat. Operator1 stated he went back to check on the kid that he had heard the man yell that his kid was hurt and that the father yelled again that his kid was hurt and took off. He followed until the man and boy turned off and that he went on to the marina to report the accident. 

Operator1 stated he wasn't that familiar with the lake and he knew to come to the marina to report it. Subject stated that they ran over the boat rope and when they tried to  check on the kid that the father cursed them. They apologized and that they followed until the father turned another direction and they came to the marina to report the accident. Subject and Operator1 both stated that they didn't see the rope in the water. 

Officer's asked the deputy, Tpr., and corp ranger's if it seemed like Operator1 and Subject were trying to leave the area and they stated that it didn't. The two male worker's at the marina stated that they reported the accident as soon as they arrived at the marina. Operator1 and Subject provided written statements.

We were trying to track the buoys but missed one. I saw the marsh at the last second, turned to the port side and slowed down. It was too late and the vessel hit and came to a stop.  I turned the motor off and assessed the damage. After everyone was accounted for we pushed the boat off the marsh and continued back to the marina where we called EMS. 

- Investigation on scene.  It should be noted Atlantic City Troopers responded to this incident at 0900 on 6/11/17. Once at Atlantic City Medical Center I interacted with the Victim and her father. The victim was currently admitted for a fractured clavicle. No other injuries were reported. The father was also present and gave his accounts of the vessel accident. 

- Witness statement #1 - Victim’s father stated Operator was operating the vessel at night. He and other passenger were attempting to track the buoys and direct Operator. After they lost track of the buoys someone yelled land. The vessel turned to the left and struck ground. Victim was dumped out of the boat onto the marsh. When she got up she immediately had pain in her chest and shoulder.  The boat was then pushed off the marsh and driven back to the dock where EMS was called for Victim. Operator then departed the scene with EMS and the vessel was trailered by the owner.  Victim was treated and released from Atlantic City Medical center later that day. 

No other parties reported injury and no damage was reported to the vessel. In conclusion it is this troopers opinion that excess speed and lack of knowledge of the waterway led to the cause of this vessel accident.

On 08/06/2017, at about 08:00 p.m., this vessel was cruising on the Columbia River near the Columbia Park East Boat Launch, located near Pasco, WA in Franklin county.

According to Law Enforcement, the vessel was traveling West at this location.  The Operator reportedly swerved to miss a log that was floating in the water.  The story changed to a Tan Pontoon Boat, then to a Yamaha Ski Boat that was racing this vessel and Operator had to make a hard to port turn to avoid colliding with the Starboard side of the Yamaha Ski Boat.  

The Yamaha vessel was reportedly traveling on the Portside of this vessel and slowed.  This vessel then began to turn to the portside and the Yamaha Ski Boat sped up and Operator had to turn hard to the starboard to avoid a collision.    

The maneuver caused three male passengers aboard this vessel, who were seated on the rear engine cover, to be thrown from the vessel.  Two of the males surfaced and the third male was reportedly sitting between the other two males prior to the incident.  He did not surface after being thrown from the vessel and is presumed to have drowned.  None of the three males were wearing a PFD.

Officers arrived at the dock to find the Operator standing on the dock drinking a Coors Light Beer.  Operator reportedly stated he began drinking beer after the incident.

Operator was actively towing two people on a ski tube when he made a port turn in the river.  During this maneuver it is believed Operator began his turn too close to the tree line in the river, thus causing the tube to swing wide and strike the trees near the bank.  This action caused victims to be ejected from the tube and strike the trees near the bank, causing injuries to both parties.  Alcohol was determined not to be a factor in this incident.

Tuber1 suffered a concussion and a broken clavicle from the impact.
Tuber2 suffered a broken right elbow as a result of the incident.
PFD’s were used by both victims.

Upon conclusion of the investigation, based on the evidence to date, Operator was determined to be fault in the incident.  Investigators concluded that the sharpness of his turn, the speed at which he executed said turn and the operators inattention were all contributing factors in this incidents occurrence.  Operator was subsequently issued a citation for carless operation of a vessel.

Operator1 stated that he was trying to avoid hitting a vessel that the wind was pushing him towards and put his vessel in reverse to do so. He then realized that he was about to strike a nearby piling and put his vessel back in forward gear but did end up hitting the piling, causing him to slip and fall, and to lose control of his vessel. 

When this happened, he accidently put the vessel in a hard acceleration and struck Vessel 2 which was unoccupied and moored to the dock a short distance away. Vessel 1 impacted Vessel 2 with it's bow, just occurred on Vessel 2 while there was only very minor damage to Vessel 1. Neither Operator1 nor his passenger were injured in this incident.

The owner/operator of ""About Time"" MD 2587 BP, a 30ft Cruisers yacht struck the side of a docked vessel while he was docking  According to eye witnesses, Operator2 was backing into his slip, number 26, at the North East Marina and then drove forward and stuck the starboard side of ""Essex Villers"" MD 6397 BG a 28ft Chaparral yacht.  V1 owner was standing on the dock behind his vessel at slip A-13, when Operator2 struck his vessel.  V1 owner then observed Operator2 reverse his vessel and then drive forward again striking the same place on the starboard side a second time.  At this point Operator2 was able to reverse his vessel into his slip and secure his dock lines.  V1 owner's vessel sustained a broken side window, bent cleat and possible structural hull damage from the impact.

 A verbal argument took place across the fairway between V1 owner and Operator2 and according to V1 owner and another eye witness, Operator2 was intoxicated.  V1 owner instructed Operator2 to come over to his dock and Operator2 complied.  Operator2 was asked how much alcohol he had consumed he replied ""Too much"".  Operator2 did provide his name, address, insurance information and driver's license number but not his phone number or vessel information to V1 owner, as required by state regulation.  V1 owner and Witness told Operator2 at least four times that he had to stay until the Maryland Natural Resources Police arrived however Operator2 got in a Silver BMW 700 series and left the scene.   

 When officer's arrived on scene and found that Operator2 had left the scene a BOLO was sent out through MSP.  Operator2 was not located.   Based on eye witness statements it is possible Operator2 was intoxicated while operating a vessel however there is not sufficient evidence to charge Operator2 with this offense.  It is this officers opinion based upon his training, knowledge and experience there is probable cause to charge Operator2 with operating a vessel in a Reckless or Dangerous Manner and with Negligent and Reckless boating based upon the facts that the first time Operator2 struck V1 owner's vessel it would be considered Negligent boating since it was unintentional.  However the second time Operator2 struck V1 owner's vessel he had the option of stopping the vessel and assessing the situation but he drove into V1 owner's vessel again and therefore considered intentional and thus Reckless boating.

Vessel #1 is a 1996 63 ft yacht with documentation numbers 909405. V1 appeared to have damage to the hull on both sides of the bow. In talking to V1 operator he gave a sworn statement that at approximately 1125 hrs he was leaving his slip at idle speed and attempted to make a turn to starboard to leave the Yacht basin when he realized that his controls were not responding properly. Vessel #1 then made contact with vessel #2 on its’ port side bow and the dock it was moored up to.

They reported no injuries and that the vessel was safely beached on the north side of fort mccray. They also stated that US Tow Boat was en route to remove the vessel. When US Tow Boat arrived it was decided that the vessel would be anchored and removed the next morning due to extreme damage to the bow. I also spoke with the Owner/Operator by phone and gathered all his contact information. I informed the owner I would contact him first thing in the morning and get a written statement with pictures of the vessel. 

    On 11/27/17 at 06:30 a.m. I arrived at the beached vessel and took pictures of the damage and the buoy that was impacted. I made contact with the owner and had him meet at the vessel for a written statement. He advised that he and his son were traveling north from the gulf into the pass and when he started to turn east towards shoreline park he impacted the buoy without seeing it. He stated he was traveling approximately 15-20 knots and did not see the buoy. After the impact some good Samaritan's stopped and assisted until Coast Guard arrived a few minutes later. No personal injuries were sustained just damage to the vessel. He has no other information. A statement is attached with this report.

    On 11/30/17 at 0800 I contacted operator via telephone and he stated that he was a little sore and that he still could not remember how he hit the channel marker. He advised that when he hit the Buoy he was ejected from the vessel and the ignition safety switch lanyard he had attached engaged and shut the vessel down. When he was in water he grabbed the anchor line that was attached to buoy and pulled himself to the buoy. He then had his son, who was on the vessel, start the vessel and position it so he could board. After boarding the vessel some bystanders assisted them and helped contact Coast Guard. Coast Guard arrived and beached the vessel for safety reasons. US Tow Boat arrived and secured the vessel so it could be removed in the morning. The Operator and Passenger were transported to the Coast Guard Station.

Sgt. drove our patrol boat back to piver's island where our patrol vehicles were located.  I tried to call the phone number advised to me by raleigh dispatch but did not get an answer.  Sgt. and i arrived at the address given to us at approximately 5:00 pm.  Upon arrival, i spoke with the owner of the damaged vessel.  

For purposes of this report, vessel, nc 7099 eb, will be referred to as vessel two.  V2 subject reported that his vessel was anchored about 100 feet off of carrot island facing the duke marine lab on piver's island.  

He reported another vessel collided with the port (left) side of his vessel.  For purposes of this report, Operator1's vessel, nc 5834 dz, will be referred to as vessel one.  

V2 subject reported just before the collision, one of the occupants of his vessel was swimming in the water near vessel two.  V2 subject reported he and other occupants on his vessel, saw vessel one coming towards them.  He reported they tried to get the attention of vessel one's operator.  

V2 subject reported they pulled swimmer out of the water so she would not get struck by vessel one.  V2 subject reported it appeared that the reason the collision occurred was because Operator1 was not paying attention to where his moving vessel was headed.  V2 subject reported that he saw Operator1 put vessel one in forward gear.  He reported Operator1 then went to the back of vessel one and appeared to be messing with something.  V2 subject reported a girl in the vessel one shouted, “daddy” just before the collision.  

I also spoke with subject1 who reported he took several photos of vessel one after the collision occurred.  Subject1 emailed me three photographs of vessel one and its occupants.  V2 subject reported Operator1 did stop and exchange contact information after the collision occurred.  I did photograph the damaged area of vessel two.  I observed a damaged area in the blue paint and fiberglass that was approximately four inches long on the port side of vessel two.   

After speaking with V2 subject, Sgt. and i then patrolled to Operator1's residence to speak with him about the incident.  We arrived at his residence at approximately 6:00 pm.  Upon arrival, i spoke with Operator1.  It is worth noting that Operator1 was consuming an alcoholic beverage while i was speaking with him.  Operator1 reported that prior to the collision occurring, he pulled the anchor of his vessel up out of the water and put the “clutch ahead”.  He reported other occupants of his vessel were attempting to pull up the tube that was being towed by vessel one.  He reported he was looking back towards the tube when the girls on the vessel started yelling, “daddy, we are getting close to this boat.”  He reported his vessel then barely hit the other vessel on the port side.  Operator1 gave me permission to take a look at his vessel which was parked in his back yard.  I did observe a very small amount of blue paint on the very tip of the bow of vessel one.  There was no damage to vessel one that i could tell.  

I charged Operator1 with operating a vessel on the waters of the state in a negligent manner so as to endanger life, limb, or property.  Nothing further at this time.

The vessel was traveling on pOperator, towing a passenger on an inflatable (tube like) device.  The passenger fell off of the tube shortly before the vessel and operator collided with a fixed object. The operator was unresponsive and taken to Cape Coral Hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

Operator was operating the PWC and Subject was riding on the tube like inflatable device.  Operator had just completed a left turn and was heading west along the shoreline. As the two passed the Syracuse Canal, Operator accelerated rapidly. This rapid acceleration sprayed water onto Subject’s face and he fell off of the tube device. When Subject surfaced he noticed that the PWC was in the bushes and he could not see his brother, Operator. 

Subject started looking around for Operator, he was 10 to 15 yards away from the PWC. As Subject started to swim towards the PWC he noticed Operator under the dock. Subject immediately swam to Operator, turned him over, put Operator on his chest, keeping his head above water and yelled for help. Subject stated he had no idea what to do. Subject stated that EMS and the police arrived quickly.

 Subject stated that neither he nor operator were drinking prior to the accident. Operator was traveling approximately 35 to 40 miles per hour. Operator has over 100 hours of experience operating that PWC. They can both swim well and were wearing their life jackets. The weather was calm and sunny. There were no mechanical issues with the PWC and it was running well;

I returned the call to dispatch to find out information about the vessel to which they had none.  At 1430 hours on August 22 I went on the water at El Dorado and found a mostly sunk vessel with KA numbers KA2141AA.  

I called the registrant and asked Owner about the boat and what his plans were to get it out.  Owner stated he had hit something under the water and it sunk and he was leaving it up to insurance to get the boat out.  I told Owner the boat needed to get out of the water now since it had been 3 days already whether it was him or insurance.  I set up a time to meet with Owner to get his and the boat''s information.  On August 23, at 1430 hours I met with Owner in Wichita at his residence.  I asked Owner to explain what happened.  

Owner stated it was his second time on El Dorado in years and he was out there to explore the lake with his wife.  Owner stated they were in the area of Sailboat Cove and was following a boat through the timber.  Owner stated he felt his boat hit something under the water and the steering was acting weird after the impact like the rudder had broke.  Owner stated the boat had an inboard motor.  After the impact, Owner stated there was water coming into the boat and the bilge was running.  

Owner then flagged down a nearby boat who took everybody on board.  Owner stated once they were on the other boat, his boat sunk on the back end with just the nose sticking out.  Owner stated the boat they were on tried to tow in his boat until the rope broke.  I collected his information and the boats information.

I noticed the back rudder was broke and water was dumping out of the boat through the hole.  I could see on the boat where the impact had caused the rudder to cut into the fiberglass of the back of the boat.  I also noticed damage to the propeller and asked Owner if this was new damage to which he stated yes.  I had noticed on his title that the boat engine horsepower was 44 and the engine in the vessel was much larger.  I asked Owner what horsepower this engine was and told 275.  I took photos of the damage and cleared the scene at 1930 hours.

Subject1 stated that the other vessel, a Nitro Bass Boat was docked immediately behind the vessel of Subject2 facing the opposite direction. The Bass boat apparently became unsecured and due to the heavy wakes, the stern of the vessel landed on the stern of Subject2's vessel. 

Subject1 then attempted to push the vessel off the swim deck when it became even more unsecured and ended up parallel with the starboard side of Subject2's vessel. Subject1 observed a teenage female and a small baby on board the bass boat, and with the assistance of a passerby, were able to get the baby off the bass boat and to the mother who was on the dock.

The injured subject was reported have a possible fractured femur.  

I had been sitting at the Jojoba Boat ramp when the incident was dispatched and was able to attract the attention of the boat with my lights and horn.  They changed direction and came over to the Jojoba dock.  Medical Rescue were present with me prior to the arrival of the injured subject.  They made contact with the injured person on arrival and provided treatment until Rural Metro personnel arrived.  The subjects right upper leg appeared to be deformed and swollen.

The operator of the boat told me they were just south of the Marina out in main bay when the incident occurred.  He said they were surfing and had just started to pull the victim when Victim went down.  They heard Victim screaming in pain.  They were able to get Victim onto the transom area of the boat and while someone held his leg they drove to the boat dock.  He said they were going about 9mph when the incident happened.

Victim said he was having trouble getting up in the water when something gave in his leg causing a lot of pain.

Rural Metro medic started an IV and administered some pain medication prior to moving Victim to a backboard and onto the gurney.  They transported him code 3 to Scottsdale Osborn, non-life threatening.

Operator #1 was sitting on the PWC and the victim was standing on the front of the trailer in the area of the trailer hitch. The trailer was backed into the water and attached to the tow vehicle. As the PWC floated off the trailer, the operator started it's motor. The victim then stated that the PWC, operated by #1, drove toward him and the trailer he was standing on. He told operator not to hit him. He added that the operator appeared to be having trouble controlling the PWC, and she drove the PWC into him while he was standing on the trailer. 

He sustained injuries and his brother, who was also at the landing, drove him to the hospital for medical care. The victim expressed concern about the operator not taking responsibility for the accident. He immediately confronted her, and she stated ""don't tell me how to drive my jet ski."" The deputy attempted to contact the PWC operator on 6/13/17. He left a voice mail message. She returned his call on 6/14 and said she didn't have time to talk to him about the incident until the following week. She called him again on 7/5/17 and stated she had been operating the PWC. She was unsure of operating the PWC with it's motor running close to the trailer. She said it was a slow speed accident. She said she had not been drinking. It is unknown whether she was wearing a life jacket at the time of the incident. There was no damage to the PWC.

Blast off begins each Thursday night at approximately 6:00 p.m. from the south end of the lake near the levee/spillway area. The blast off consists of every boater leaving at the same time, this is known as a ""Shot Gun"" style blast off. 
     On this evening the signal for blast off was given around the time of 6:00 p.m.  Boaters began traveling North to the opposite end of the lake.  Operator1 was operating his boat by himself and lead the group of vessels. He reached a speed of approximately 70 mph.  Operator2 was also traveling North with his granddaughter riding as a passenger.  He was trailing Operator1..  At approximately 6:02 p.m. Operator1 began decreasing his speed as he approached his fishing destination.  Operator2 quickly approached the starboard stern of Operator1''s  vessel.  At this point the portside bow of Operator2''s vessel struck Operator1''s motor causing his vessel to ramp.  

While airborne, Operator2 and occupant were ejected from their vessel and landed in the water.  Just before the time of impact Operator1 looked back and saw Operator2''s bow turn to the left.  Operator1 clutched the steering wheel and lowered his body to avoid Operator2''s vessel.  Operator1''s vessel stayed upright and he was not ejected.  Operator2''s vessel rolled over in the air which caused the vessel to capsize.  Operator1 became injured when he struck his boat upon impact.",17-1-01830,NA,NA,NA

Subject stated that he had been contacted to assist in recovering a grounded boat and he wanted to make sure that a Game Warden had been informed of the accident prior to him taking action.  I explained to Subject that a Game Warden had not been informed of the accident and to not move the boat until a Game Warden had conducted an accident investigation.  The location of the grounded boat was described as the eastern most point of Jacob's Creek Park, on the north side of Canyon Lake, Comal County, Texas.  I traveled to the location and observed a large, 31 ft, cabin cruiser, TX 5479 KC, grounded in shallow water on the before mentioned point at Jacob's Creek Park.  The boat's owner was at the location and I found him.
Operator explained that on the night of 11/25/2017 at about 11:00 pm, he was operating in a west bound direction, traveling from the Canyon Lake Dam to Canyon Lake Marina.  Operator stated that he was traveling approximately 20 mph.  Operator described the weather to be clear, but dark with no moon.  Operator stated that there were 6 people, including himself, on board at the time of the accident.  Operator reported that neither he or any of his passengers were injured beyond first aid.  Operator stated that he did not know that reporting of a boating accident was required.  Operator stated that he was relying on his onboard GPS for his navigational course.  Operator stated that at the time of the accident, the onboard  GPS showed his location to be out in the middle of the lake.
Due to the time lapse between the accident occurring and the accident investigation, a determination of alcohol use as a contributing factor was not practical. 
I found that Operator operated his vessel in a negligent manner. Considering all factors present, specifically the lack of visibility, he should have reduced his vessel's speed to a rate that would have prevented the grounding.
The next week I inspected the GPS located in this vessel.  I found the GPS to be working properly, with the GPS indicating the present location with reasonable accuracy.  I found the GPS “tracking” feature was turned off and there was no record of the vessel's track prior to the accident.",NA,NA,NA,NA
